# Q3030: wallet-standard features called with an injected account in generateDomainType.ts

## Question
ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet spreads `{...input, account: this.#t}` into every feature call; can an attacker construct the wrapper with an account that does not match the underlying wallet so generateDomainType: rebuilds EIP712Domain from present domain keys (name/version/chainId/verifyingContract/salt) requests signatures for a foreign account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/typedData/generateDomainType.ts](src/utils/typedData/generateDomainType.ts) - generateDomainType: rebuilds EIP712Domain from present domain keys (name/version/chainId/verifyingContract/salt)
- Entrypoint: cross-app privy.crossApp.wallet.signTypedData({typedData, ...})
- Attacker controls: the typedData.domain and typedData.types objects
- Exploit idea: Construct the wrapper with a mismatched account/wallet pair.
- Invariant to test: The wrapped account must be verified to belong to the wrapped wallet.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct generateDomainType: rebuilds EIP712Domain from present domain keys (name/version/chainId/verifyingContract/salt) with a mismatched pair and assert construction fails.
