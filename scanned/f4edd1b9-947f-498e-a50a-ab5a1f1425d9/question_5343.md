# Q5343: secret ownership check on the wrong field in http_handler.send

## Question
Does the ownership check for a vault secret in `send` at the v2 gateway HTTP handler (HandleJSONRPCUserMessage/makeOutgoingRequest) use a request field rather than the recovered signer, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests read or overwrite another owner's secret?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_handler.go) -> `send`
- Entrypoint: the v2 gateway HTTP handler (HandleJSONRPCUserMessage/makeOutgoingRequest)
- Attacker controls: the JSON-RPC method and params (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `JSON-RPC method and params` naming the victim's owner/namespace.
- Invariant to test: secret access must be authorized against the recovered signer only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test reading a foreign owner's secret
