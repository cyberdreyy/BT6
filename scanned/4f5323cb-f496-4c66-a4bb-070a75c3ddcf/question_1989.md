# Q1989: chain id normalisation strips context in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
The chainId is normalised with replace('eip155:',''); can an attacker supply a chainId form that survives normalisation and makes the signed message describe a different chain than the one bound server-side?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Pass chainId values such as 'eip155:eip155:1' or '01' and inspect the resulting message.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity in the authentication message must be canonical and unambiguous.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: feed a table of chainId encodings to createSiwsMessage({address and assert a single canonical output or a rejection.
