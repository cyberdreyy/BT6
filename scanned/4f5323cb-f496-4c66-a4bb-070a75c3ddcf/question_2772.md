# Q2772: switchActiveUser reloads the wallet iframe mid-operation in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
UserApi.switchActiveUser calls embedded.reload(), which flushes the shared callback queue; can an attacker use PrivyInternal.fetch to reject or hijack another in-flight wallet operation?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Start a signature, then switch users and observe the flush rejecting the pending callback.
- Invariant to test: A user switch must not be able to interfere with an unrelated in-flight signing operation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start a sign request, call PrivyInternal.fetch, and assert the pending request neither resolves with foreign data nor leaks its callback.
