# Q0856: quoteCreatedAt is a client cursor in polling.ts

## Question
The `after` query is the caller's quoteCreatedAt; can an attacker pass a cursor through getDeposit that surfaces an older or unrelated order as the user's deposit?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Pass a much earlier cursor and observe the order returned.
- Invariant to test: The polling cursor must be server-issued and bound to the quote.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a stale cursor to getDeposit and assert it is refused.
