# Q0161: convert_memo_transfer crashes the process from one request (parse_token_extension.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `convert_memo_transfer` in `account-decoder/src/parse_token_extension.rs` with a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not, and make `convert_memo_transfer` panic, abort, or block the runtime from that single request, so that the invariant "No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response." breaks and the result is RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `account-decoder/src/parse_token_extension.rs` -> `convert_memo_transfer()` (around line 220)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not
- Exploit idea: Send one request whose parameters make `convert_memo_transfer` panic, abort, or block the runtime, taking down the validator rather than only the RPC thread.
- Invariant to test: No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash - single low-rate call from one client crashes or stalls the node (20-65 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz the request parameters against `convert_memo_transfer` and assert every case returns an error response and the process survives.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
