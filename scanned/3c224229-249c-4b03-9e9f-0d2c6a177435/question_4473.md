# Q4473: legacy path skips new validation in workflow_metadata_handler.Authorize

## Question
Does the legacy message path in `Authorize` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request skip validation added on the JSON-RPC path, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests reach capability code with an under-validated request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `Authorize`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request` through the legacy envelope.
- Invariant to test: both paths must apply identical validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: differential test across legacy and JSON-RPC paths
