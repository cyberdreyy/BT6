# Q5006: expiry check allows stale entries in bundler.newBundleSummary

## Question
Does the expiry logic in `newBundleSummary` at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user keep serving a stale entry (inverted comparison, missing zero-value handling), letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests pin an outdated result?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `newBundleSummary`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: the request that determines bundle composition (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `request that determines bundle composition` around the expiry boundary.
- Invariant to test: expired entries must never be served
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: table test at expiry boundaries
