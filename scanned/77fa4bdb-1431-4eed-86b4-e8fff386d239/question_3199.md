# Q3199: clearMfa keyed by caller-supplied userId in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout forwards opts.userId to mfa.clearMfa; can an attacker pass another user's id and clear MFA state that is not theirs?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Call logout with a foreign userId and observe the proxy clearMfa invocation.
- Invariant to test: MFA state may only be cleared for the currently authenticated user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call createSiwsMessage({address with a foreign userId and assert clearMfa is called with the session's own user id or not at all.
