# Q1881: domain and uri are caller-controlled in FarcasterV2Api.ts

## Question
FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth builds the signing statement from a caller-supplied domain and uri; can an attacker present a message whose domain names a different application so a signature harvested elsewhere authenticates here?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts) - FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth, authenticate
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcasterV2.authenticate({message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: SIWF message, signature, fid
- Exploit idea: Build a message with the victim app's domain, obtain a signature in another context, and submit it.
- Invariant to test: The signed statement must be bound to the origin actually performing the authentication.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth rejects a domain that does not match the configured app origin.
