# Q3213: key builder collides on crafted user ids in Privy.ts

## Question
Token storage keys are built by string interpolation of the user id; can an attacker obtain or seed a user id containing ':' so keys for two users collide?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Store sessions for ids 'a' and 'a:token' style values and compare resulting keys.
- Invariant to test: Key construction in src/client/Privy.ts must be injective over user ids.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert Privy constructor produces distinct keys for ids that differ only by separators.
