# Q3034: failure between sign and send loses atomicity in rpc.ts

## Question
If fetchPrivyRoute throws after signing, the signature remains valid; can an attacker force that failure in rpc(): builds {version:1 and then reuse the signature at a moment of their choosing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Abort the request post-signature and replay it later.
- Invariant to test: An unused authorization signature must be invalidated.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: abort after signing in rpc(): builds {version:1 and assert the signature cannot be reused.
