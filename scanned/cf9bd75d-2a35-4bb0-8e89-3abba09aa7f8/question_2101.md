# Q2101: mock_server_random: signer signs a block whose hash covers different bytes than validated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mock_server_random` (in `stacks-signer/src/client/mod.rs`) via a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only), such that the `signer_signature_hash` and the validated block diverge, breaking the invariant that the block a signature authenticates == the block the validation proved valid — leading to signing an invalid block (chain safety)?

## Target
- File/function: `stacks-signer/src/client/mod.rs` -> `mock_server_random`
- Entrypoint: a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only)
- Attacker controls: the full proposed block contents, its claimed tenure/burn view and reorg claim, and the gossiped signer messages
- Exploit idea: the `signer_signature_hash` and the validated block diverge
- Invariant to test: the block a signature authenticates == the block the validation proved valid
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - signing an invalid block (chain safety)
- Fast validation: signer test asserting signed hash vs validated block
