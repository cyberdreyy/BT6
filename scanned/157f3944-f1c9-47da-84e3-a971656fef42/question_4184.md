# Q4184: privileged bootstrap account reachable in reaper.Work

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role authenticate at any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change through `Work` as a bootstrap/default account that remains enabled with a derivable credential?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go](core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go) -> `Work`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change
- Attacker controls: repeated reuse of an old session id (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Try `repeated reuse of an old session id` against default/bootstrap identities.
- Invariant to test: no account may exist with a credential derivable from public information
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: test asserting bootstrap accounts require an explicitly set secret
