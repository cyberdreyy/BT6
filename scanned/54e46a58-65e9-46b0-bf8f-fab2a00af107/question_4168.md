# Q4168: undecodable responses counted as valid in aggregator.signedResponseRequestIDEnabled

## Question
Does `signedResponseRequestIDEnabled` at aggregation and signature/quorum validation of vault node responses before they reach the requesting user count undecodable or error responses toward success, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests force a result with fewer honest contributions?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/aggregator.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/aggregator.go) -> `signedResponseRequestIDEnabled`
- Entrypoint: aggregation and signature/quorum validation of vault node responses before they reach the requesting user
- Attacker controls: method selection that toggles signed validation (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Trigger the mixed-response branch with `method selection that toggles signed validation`.
- Invariant to test: only successfully decoded, verified responses may count
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test with mixed decodable/undecodable responses
