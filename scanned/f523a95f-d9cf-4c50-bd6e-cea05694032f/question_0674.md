# Q0674: returned user object is not re-read from session in GuestApi.ts

## Question
Does GuestApi.create return the user object from the authenticate response (merged by mergeUser) without re-reading the freshly stored session, letting a stale or attacker-influenced response drive the app's is_new_user and linked_accounts view?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/GuestApi.ts](src/client/auth/GuestApi.ts) - GuestApi.create, session.getOrCreateGuestCredential (privy:guest:<appId>)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.guest.create()
- Attacker controls: guest credential value persisted in localStorage, repeated create calls
- Exploit idea: Return an authenticate response whose user payload disagrees with the token subject and observe which value reaches the setUser callback.
- Invariant to test: The user object handed to setUser must be consistent with the subject of the token that was just stored.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the response user.id differ from the JWT sub in the same response and assert GuestApi.create rejects instead of calling setUser.
