# Q0314: caip2 prefix matching is loose in getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts](src/solana/getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts) - getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name, rpcUrl}) - caller rpcUrl wins over the cluster default
- Entrypoint: SolanaClient construction for balance and mint reads
- Attacker controls: the cluster object passed in by the caller
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name and assert full-reference validation.
