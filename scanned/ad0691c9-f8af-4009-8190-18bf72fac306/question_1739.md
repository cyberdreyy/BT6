# Q1739: asset id map lookup unchecked in MoonpayOnRampApi.ts

## Question
toCoinbaseAssetId falls back to 'ETH' for anything that is not USDC on known chains, and the asset id map is keyed by symbol; can an attacker choose a chain/asset pair through MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign) so the on-ramp buys a different asset than the user selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/funding/MoonpayOnRampApi.ts](src/client/funding/MoonpayOnRampApi.ts) - MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign), getTransactionStatus (direct api.moonpay.com fetch with embedded pk_live key)
- Entrypoint: privy.funding.moonpay.sign(input) / getTransactionStatus({transactionId, useSandbox})
- Attacker controls: the sign input body (walletAddress, currency, amount) and transactionId
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chain with asset USDC and inspect the resulting defaultAsset.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported asset/chain pairs must be rejected, never defaulted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass unsupported pairs to MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign) and assert rejection.
