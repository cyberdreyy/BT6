# Q0588: mfaRequired event carries no operation identity in index.ts

## Question
The 'mfaRequired' event emitted from src/embedded/utils/index.ts does not identify which operation triggered it; can an attacker exploit this so the app collects a code for the wrong pending action?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/utils/index.ts](src/embedded/utils/index.ts) - throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath, getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.setRecovery({wallet, recoveryMethod, ...})
- Attacker controls: currentRecoveryMethod vs upgradeToRecoveryMethod pair, chain rpcUrls config
- Exploit idea: Trigger two operations and inspect the event payload the app receives.
- Invariant to test: MFA prompts must be attributable to the exact operation awaiting them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert the event payload emitted during throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath identifies the pending operation.
