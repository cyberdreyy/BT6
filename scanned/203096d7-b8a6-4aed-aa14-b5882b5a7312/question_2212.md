# Q2212: job spec references another owner's credential in workflow_keys_controller.Index

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role create or update a job through `Index` at GET /v2/keys/workflow that references a bridge, initiator or key belonging to someone else, causing the node to use that credential on the attacker's behalf?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/workflow_keys_controller.go](core/web/workflow_keys_controller.go) -> `Index`
- Entrypoint: GET /v2/keys/workflow
- Attacker controls: the request path and query parameters (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `request path and query parameters` referencing the foreign object by name.
- Invariant to test: specs may only reference objects the submitter is entitled to use
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: handler test submitting a spec referencing a foreign credential
