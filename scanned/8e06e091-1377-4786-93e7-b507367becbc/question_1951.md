# Q1951: smart-wallet method chosen by address membership in CrossAppApi.ts

## Question
isCrossAppWalletSmart decides between personal_sign and privy_signSmartWalletMessage purely by address membership in smart_wallets; can an attacker cause the wrong method to be selected in CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication so the signature has different semantics than the user approved?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/CrossAppApi.ts](src/client/CrossAppApi.ts) - CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication, getProviderAccessToken (Token expiry only), getCrossAppConnections, providerAccessTokenStorageKey('privy:cross-app:<appId>')
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.getProviderAccessToken(appId)
- Attacker controls: the stored provider access token string and the provider app id used to key it
- Exploit idea: Place the address in both lists and observe the chosen method.
- Invariant to test: Signing method selection must be explicit and verified against the wallet type.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct an ambiguous account and assert CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication rejects rather than guessing.
