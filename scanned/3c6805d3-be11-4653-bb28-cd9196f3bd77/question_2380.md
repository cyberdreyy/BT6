# Q2380: checked_add_lamports accepts input it should reject (instruction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `checked_add_lamports` in `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` with an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently, and have `checked_add_lamports` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`checked_add_lamports` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` -> `checked_add_lamports()` (around line 146)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `checked_add_lamports` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `checked_add_lamports` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `checked_add_lamports` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
