# Q1404: abort signal supplied by the caller in generate.ts

## Question
poll checks a caller-supplied AbortSignal; can an attacker abort generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain at a chosen moment so the app treats a completed deposit as aborted and issues a duplicate?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Abort right after the funds land.
- Invariant to test: Abort must not change the recorded outcome of a settled deposit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain after settlement and assert the state reflects settlement.
