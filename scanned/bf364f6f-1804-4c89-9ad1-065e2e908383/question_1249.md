# Q1249: init and submit enrollment not bound in errors.ts

## Question
initEnrollMfa and submitEnrollMfa are separate calls with no client-side correlation; can an attacker interleave two enrollments so the code from one is submitted against the other?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/errors.ts](src/embedded/errors.ts) - PrivyIframeError type guards: errorIndicatesRecoveryIsNeeded, errorIndicatesMfaTimeout, errorIndicatesMfaVerificationFailed, errorIndicatesMaxMfaRetries, errorIndicatesMfaRateLimit
- Entrypoint: every embedded-wallet catch block
- Attacker controls: the {type, message} shape of any error object that reaches these guards
- Exploit idea: Start two enrollments and cross the submissions.
- Invariant to test: Enrollment submissions must be bound to the initialization that produced them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Integration test: cross two enrollment flows through PrivyIframeError type guards: errorIndicatesRecoveryIsNeeded and assert the mismatch is rejected.
