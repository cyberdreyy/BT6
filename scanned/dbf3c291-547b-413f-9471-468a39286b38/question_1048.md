# Q1048: maybe_take_bank_mint: mint/account probing helper can be steered to the wrong token context [duplicate-metas-affecting-remaining-account] [family-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker invoke `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy` with duplicate metas affecting remaining-account consumption order so `maybe_take_bank_mint` probes or caches the wrong token context, violating `mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts` and causing `High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss`? Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `maybe_take_bank_mint`
- Entrypoint: `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy`
- Attacker controls: duplicate metas affecting remaining-account consumption order
- Exploit idea: Helpers like token-mint selection and transfer-hook probing must bind tightly to the bank and vault actually being used. Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.
- Invariant to test: mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss
- Fast validation: Supply same-owner or same-interface token accounts from another mint and assert helpers never approve the wrong token context. Cross-substitute same-interface vaults, mints, and authorities and assert no utility-backed path accepts a foreign family.
