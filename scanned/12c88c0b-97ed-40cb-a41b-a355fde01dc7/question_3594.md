# Q3594: cross-app login caches tokens before user confirmation in getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts

## Question
loginWithCrossAppAuth calls updateOnCrossAppAuthentication with the oauth_tokens as soon as the exchange returns; can an attacker cause a token to be cached for a provider app the user never approved through getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink: cached token from storage else relink?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts) - getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink: cached token from storage else relink
- Entrypoint: cross-app wallet operations
- Attacker controls: the cached privy:cross-app:<appId> value and its decoded expiry
- Exploit idea: Return oauth_tokens for a different provider in the exchange response.
- Invariant to test: Cached provider tokens must match the provider the user authorised.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign provider token to getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink: cached token from storage else relink and assert it is not cached.
