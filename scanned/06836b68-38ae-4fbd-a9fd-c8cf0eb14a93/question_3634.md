# Q3634: link succeeds against the wrong active user in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
In multi-user mode, can an attacker switch the active user between the request and the refresh inside OAuthApi.generateURL so a credential is linked to one account but reported on another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Call the link method and switch active user while the request is in flight.
- Invariant to test: A link operation must apply to and report on a single, unchanged user id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch active user mid-flight and assert OAuthApi.generateURL fails rather than reporting success on the new user.
