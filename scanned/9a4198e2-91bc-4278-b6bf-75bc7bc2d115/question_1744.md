# Q1744: asset id map lookup unchecked in getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts

## Question
toCoinbaseAssetId falls back to 'ETH' for anything that is not USDC on known chains, and the asset id map is keyed by symbol; can an attacker choose a chain/asset pair through getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name so the on-ramp buys a different asset than the user selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts](src/solana/getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster.ts) - getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name, rpcUrl}) - caller rpcUrl wins over the cluster default
- Entrypoint: SolanaClient construction for balance and mint reads
- Attacker controls: the cluster object passed in by the caller
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chain with asset USDC and inspect the resulting defaultAsset.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported asset/chain pairs must be rejected, never defaulted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass unsupported pairs to getSolanaRpcEndpointForCluster({name and assert rejection.
