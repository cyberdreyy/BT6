# Q0568: expiry skew accepts a stale token in Token.ts

## Question
tokenIsActive applies a 30 second skew over an unverified exp; can an attacker exploit clock skew or a crafted exp so Token.parse treats an expired credential as active and skips refresh?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Set a system clock offset or craft exp and observe the refresh being skipped.
- Invariant to test: Token validity decisions must not depend on client clock or unverified claims.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: freeze Date.now past exp+skew and assert Token.parse triggers a refresh.
