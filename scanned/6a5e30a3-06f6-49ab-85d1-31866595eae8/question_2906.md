# Q2906: hex detection via loose regex in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
The hex predicate accepts any 0x-prefixed hex string of any length, including empty; can an attacker exploit that in toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction so a zero-length or odd-length value is passed to the signer?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Submit '0x' and an odd-length hex string.
- Invariant to test: Hex inputs must be length-validated before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: feed '0x' and odd-length values to toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert rejection.
