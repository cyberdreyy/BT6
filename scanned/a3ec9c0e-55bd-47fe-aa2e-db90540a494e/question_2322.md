# Q2322: authenticator response fields copied unchecked in TelegramApi.ts

## Question
TelegramApi.authenticate's snake-case transformer copies id, raw_id, clientDataJSON, authenticatorData and userHandle straight through; can an attacker submit a response whose user_handle names another account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts](src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts) - TelegramApi.authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.telegram.authenticate({telegramWebAppData, telegramAuthResult, captchaToken, mode})
- Attacker controls: telegram_web_app_data blob, telegram_auth_result, captcha_token, mode
- Exploit idea: Assemble an authenticator response object by hand and pass it to the login method.
- Invariant to test: src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts must not forward an assertion whose handle disagrees with the challenge it requested.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a response with a foreign user_handle and assert the SDK rejects before the network call.
