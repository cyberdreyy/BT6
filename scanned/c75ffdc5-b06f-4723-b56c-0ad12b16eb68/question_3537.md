# Q3537: refresh failure destroys local state in Session.ts

## Question
On MISSING_OR_INVALID_TOKEN, _refreshSession calls destroyLocalState; can an attacker force that error to arrive during Session.updateWithTokensResponse so a legitimate session is dropped and re-authentication is redirected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Session.ts](src/Session.ts) - Session.updateWithTokensResponse, destroyLocalState, switchActiveUserId, backfillLegacySession, getOrCreateGuestCredential, tokenIsActive
- Entrypoint: any login/refresh/logout path
- Attacker controls: stored values under privy:token / privy:pat / privy:refresh_token / privy:id-token / privy:active-user / privy:saved-users, cookie twins
- Exploit idea: Return the error code from the refresh route while the user is mid-flow.
- Invariant to test: Session destruction must follow an authenticated signal, not any error carrying that code.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return the error from an unauthenticated response and assert Session.updateWithTokensResponse does not clear stored tokens.
