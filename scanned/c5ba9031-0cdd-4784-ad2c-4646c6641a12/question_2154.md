# Q2154: raw-sign hashes anything in rpc.ts

## Question
rawSign forwards the caller's params to WalletRawSign under the same signed envelope; can an attacker use rpc(): builds {version:1 to obtain a raw signature over a transaction digest that the wallet would never sign through a typed path?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Submit a transaction hash through the raw-sign entrypoint.
- Invariant to test: Raw-hash signing must require an explicit, distinct user approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit a transaction digest through rpc(): builds {version:1 and assert an approval gate is enforced.
