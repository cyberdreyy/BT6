# Q2133: signer list concatenated without validation in walletRpc.ts

## Question
addSessionSigners concatenates the caller's signers array onto the existing list with no dedupe or ownership check; can an attacker add a signer key they control through handleWalletApiRpc?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Call the add path with an attacker-held signer entry.
- Invariant to test: Session signers must be validated and require explicit user approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an arbitrary signer to handleWalletApiRpc and assert an approval gate is enforced.
