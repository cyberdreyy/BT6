# Q1732: MFA requirement skipped in gql.AuthenticateGQL

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role complete authentication through `AuthenticateGQL` at POST /query (GraphQL) guarded by AuthenticateGQL without satisfying the WebAuthn step, for example by omitting the assertion field when credentials exist?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/gql.go](core/web/auth/gql.go) -> `AuthenticateGQL`
- Entrypoint: POST /query (GraphQL) guarded by AuthenticateGQL
- Attacker controls: the session cookie (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `session cookie` with the MFA field absent, null, or an empty object.
- Invariant to test: if the user has registered credentials, authentication must fail without a valid assertion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the login path for users with and without registered credentials
