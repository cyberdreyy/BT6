# Q422: derive_juplend_supply_position: stored PDA is canonical at init but not revalidated later [deposit-with-one-owner-identity] [runtime-recheck]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker make `juplend_deposit` reach `derive_juplend_supply_position` with deposit with one owner identity but another position context so a stored PDA/address canonical at init is later used without revalidation, violating `Juplend supply-position derivation must be unique to the intended owner, bank, and external market context` and causing `High: value redirected to the wrong external position or later reward theft`? Focus specifically on whether runtime constraints recompute the PDA instead of trusting caller-supplied prederived addresses.

## Target
- File/function: `type-crate/src/pdas.rs` / `derive_juplend_supply_position`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: deposit with one owner identity but another position context
- Exploit idea: Audit flows that persist derived addresses and later trust them blindly when accounts can be caller-supplied again. Focus specifically on whether runtime constraints recompute the PDA instead of trusting caller-supplied prederived addresses.
- Invariant to test: Juplend supply-position derivation must be unique to the intended owner, bank, and external market context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: value redirected to the wrong external position or later reward theft
- Fast validation: Corrupt or substitute the later-supplied account and assert the runtime path recomputes and rechecks the canonical address. Supply attacker-prederived candidates and assert runtime rejects everything except the exact recomputed PDA.
