# Q3546: route group ordering in helpers.addForbiddenErrorHeaders

## Question
Does the registration order around `addForbiddenErrorHeaders` place an unauthenticated group after an authenticated one so a path registered twice is served by the unauthenticated handler for an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/helpers.go](core/web/auth/helpers.go) -> `addForbiddenErrorHeaders`
- Entrypoint: any /v2 or /query error response path
- Attacker controls: malformed JSON bodies (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `malformed JSON bodies` against paths registered in more than one group.
- Invariant to test: each path may be served by exactly one middleware chain, the most restrictive one
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: route-table test asserting no path is registered in both authenticated and unauthenticated groups
