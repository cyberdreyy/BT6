# Q0999: concurrent login writes interleave active-user pointer in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker race two privy.auth.siws flow message construction calls so storeActiveUserId writes user B while the later-resolving login stores user A's tokens under the null key, making privy:active-user point at the wrong credentials?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Fire both logins, delay one response, then read getActiveUserId and getCustomerAccessToken.
- Invariant to test: privy:active-user and the null-keyed token copy must always describe the same subject.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: interleave two createSiwsMessage({address promises with controlled resolution order and assert Token.parse(getCustomerAccessToken()).subject === getActiveUserId().
