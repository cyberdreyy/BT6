# Q1877: domain and uri are caller-controlled in SiweApi.ts

## Question
SiweApi.init builds the signing statement from a caller-supplied domain and uri; can an attacker present a message whose domain names a different application so a signature harvested elsewhere authenticates here?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts](src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts) - SiweApi.init, loginWithSiwe, linkWithSiwe, unlinkWallet, generateSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siwe.init(wallet, domain, uri) then loginWithSiwe(signature, wallet, message)
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, chainId, walletClientType, connectorType, full message override, signature
- Exploit idea: Build a message with the victim app's domain, obtain a signature in another context, and submit it.
- Invariant to test: The signed statement must be bound to the origin actually performing the authentication.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert SiweApi.init rejects a domain that does not match the configured app origin.
