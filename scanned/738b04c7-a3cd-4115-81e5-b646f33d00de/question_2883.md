# Q2883: app config cached and trusted in Privy.ts

## Question
AppApi memoises _smartWalletConfig and getConfig results; can an attacker cause Privy constructor to keep serving a config fetched under a different app or user context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Fetch the config, change context, and observe the cached value still driving wallet behaviour.
- Invariant to test: Cached configuration must be invalidated when the app or session context changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: change appId and assert Privy constructor refetches rather than returning the memoised config.
