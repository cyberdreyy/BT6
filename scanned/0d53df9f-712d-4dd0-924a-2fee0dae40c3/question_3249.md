# Q3249: disconnect leaves the wrapper usable in client.ts

## Question
disconnect only calls the standard feature; can an attacker keep using SolanaClient.invokeRpc after disconnect so signatures are still requested from a wallet the user disconnected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Call disconnect then sign.
- Invariant to test: A disconnected wallet wrapper must refuse further operations.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call disconnect then sign through SolanaClient.invokeRpc and assert rejection.
