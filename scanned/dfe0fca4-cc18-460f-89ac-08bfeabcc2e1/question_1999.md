# Q1999: bank::process_genesis_config — prioritization-fee-cache skew

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `bank::process_genesis_config` and feed transactions so the prioritization fee cache reports values diverging across nodes or enabling under-pricing, so that the invariant "the prioritization fee cache is a deterministic function of committed transactions" is violated, leading to Consensus / DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank.rs` -> `process_genesis_config`
- Entrypoint: a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the compute-unit-price and account set of transactions it submits
- Exploit idea: Feed transactions so the prioritization fee cache reports values diverging across nodes or enabling under-pricing.
- Invariant to test: the prioritization fee cache is a deterministic function of committed transactions.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus / DoS — High
- Fast validation: write a bank test committing the block on two independent banks and asserting identical bank hash / dedup behavior.
