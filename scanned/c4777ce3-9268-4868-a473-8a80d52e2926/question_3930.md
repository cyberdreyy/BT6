# Q3930: action factories bound to a client at import in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
The crossApp barrel binds actions to a client instance; can an attacker retain a bound action from one session and invoke it after a switch through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction]?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Bind actions as user A, switch to B, then invoke.
- Invariant to test: Bound actions must revalidate the session on each call.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: invoke a stale bound action from crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] after a switch and assert refusal.
