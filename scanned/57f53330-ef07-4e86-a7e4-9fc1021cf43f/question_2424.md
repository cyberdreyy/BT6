# Q2424: challenge not bound to the stored options in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
Does OAuthApi.generateURL accept a challenge argument supplied by the caller rather than the one returned by the matching options call, enabling replay of a previously captured assertion?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Call the options method, discard the challenge, and log in with an older challenge plus its captured assertion.
- Invariant to test: The challenge submitted must be the one issued for this ceremony.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a stale challenge to OAuthApi.generateURL and assert it is rejected.
