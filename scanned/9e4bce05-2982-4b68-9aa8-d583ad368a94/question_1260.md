# Q1260: secret identifier traversal in message_util.ValidatedMessageFromResp

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address another namespace or owner through identifier separators/encoding in the request validated by `ValidatedMessageFromResp` at validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go) -> `ValidatedMessageFromResp`
- Entrypoint: validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses
- Attacker controls: the message body fields (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `message body fields` with separators, encoded delimiters or empty components.
- Invariant to test: identifier components must be validated and joined unambiguously
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test over identifier parsing with hostile components
