# Q0144: mfaAlwaysRequired only on three operations in MfaPasskeyApi.ts

## Question
Only verifyMfa, unenrollMfa and unlinkPasskey are invoked with mfaAlwaysRequired; can an attacker reach a comparable privileged operation in src/client/mfa/MfaPasskeyApi.ts that skips the always-on gate?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaPasskeyApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaPasskeyApi.ts) - MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.passkey.generateAuthenticationOptions(input)
- Attacker controls: relying party and options fields echoed into the passkey ceremony
- Exploit idea: Enumerate the operations routed through invokeWithMfa and compare their flags.
- Invariant to test: Every operation that changes MFA state or produces a signature must be gated identically.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert each privileged operation reachable from MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions sets mfaAlwaysRequired.
