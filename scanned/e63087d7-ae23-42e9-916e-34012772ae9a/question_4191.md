# Q4191: privileged bootstrap account reachable in user_controller.Create

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role authenticate at /v2/users and /v2/user/* (password change, API token create/delete) through `Create` as a bootstrap/default account that remains enabled with a derivable credential?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/user_controller.go](core/web/user_controller.go) -> `Create`
- Entrypoint: /v2/users and /v2/user/* (password change, API token create/delete)
- Attacker controls: API token access key (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Try `API token access key` against default/bootstrap identities.
- Invariant to test: no account may exist with a credential derivable from public information
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: test asserting bootstrap accounts require an explicitly set secret
