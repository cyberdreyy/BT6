# Q0345: import path plants attacker key material in jobs_controller.Index

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin) import key material through `Index` at POST/PATCH /v2/jobs (edit role) so the node later signs oracle reports or transactions with an attacker-known key?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/jobs_controller.go](core/web/jobs_controller.go) -> `Index`
- Entrypoint: POST/PATCH /v2/jobs (edit role)
- Attacker controls: the TOML job spec body (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin); no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `TOML job spec body` containing a key the attacker generated.
- Invariant to test: key import must be admin-only and validated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of funds: unauthorized transaction submission signed by node-held EVM keys
- Fast validation: handler test importing a key from a non-admin session
