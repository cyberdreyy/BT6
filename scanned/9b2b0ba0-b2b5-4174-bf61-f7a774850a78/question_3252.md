# Q3252: disconnect leaves the wrapper usable in smart-wallets.ts

## Question
disconnect only calls the standard feature; can an attacker keep using smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY after disconnect so signatures are still requested from a wallet the user disconnected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/smart-wallets.ts](src/smart-wallets.ts) - smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY, COINBASE_SMART_WALLET, KERNEL, LIGHT_ACCOUNT, SAFE, THIRDWEB, NEXUS)
- Entrypoint: import {...} from '@privy-io/js-sdk-core/smart-wallets'
- Attacker controls: smart wallet type/version strings used for linking and routing
- Exploit idea: Call disconnect then sign.
- Invariant to test: A disconnected wallet wrapper must refuse further operations.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call disconnect then sign through smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY and assert rejection.
