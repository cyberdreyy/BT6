# Q0439: classification fields are attacker-shaped in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
Embedded classification requires type wallet, wallet_client_type privy and connector_type embedded; can an attacker present a linked account with those fields through validatePhoneNumber so an external wallet is treated as an embedded one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Pass an account with spoofed classification fields.
- Invariant to test: Classification must come from server-confirmed account records.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass spoofed fields to validatePhoneNumber and assert re-validation.
