# Q0170: from address defaults to the wallet in generateDomainType.ts

## Question
handlePopulateTransaction and handleEstimateGas use `transaction.from ?? this._account.address` while the signature is produced by the wallet regardless; can an attacker set a from that differs from the signer so the populated nonce and gas describe a different account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/typedData/generateDomainType.ts](src/utils/typedData/generateDomainType.ts) - generateDomainType: rebuilds EIP712Domain from present domain keys (name/version/chainId/verifyingContract/salt)
- Entrypoint: cross-app privy.crossApp.wallet.signTypedData({typedData, ...})
- Attacker controls: the typedData.domain and typedData.types objects
- Exploit idea: Send a transaction with a foreign from and compare the populated fields to the signing account.
- Invariant to test: Populated fields must be derived from the account that will actually sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign from to generateDomainType: rebuilds EIP712Domain from present domain keys (name/version/chainId/verifyingContract/salt) and assert rejection or that population uses the signer address.
