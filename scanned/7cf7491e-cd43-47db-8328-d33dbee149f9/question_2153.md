# Q2153: cpi_juplend_deposit: deposit uses the right accounts but wrong amount domain [optional-accounts-that-affect-destination] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `juplend_deposit` with optional accounts that affect destination or market resolution so `cpi_juplend_deposit` measures external deposit value in the wrong amount domain, breaking `Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly` and causing `Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `cpi_juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: optional accounts that affect destination or market resolution
- Exploit idea: Stress token amount vs share amount vs fee-adjusted amount conversions around the external CPI boundary. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Fuzz boundary amounts and assert internal and external ledgers reconcile exactly after every deposit. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
