# Q2885: app config cached and trusted in AppApi.ts

## Question
AppApi memoises _smartWalletConfig and getConfig results; can an attacker cause AppApi.getConfig to keep serving a config fetched under a different app or user context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Fetch the config, change context, and observe the cached value still driving wallet behaviour.
- Invariant to test: Cached configuration must be invalidated when the app or session context changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: change appId and assert AppApi.getConfig refetches rather than returning the memoised config.
