# Q3878: events reveal credential lifecycle in toAbortSignalTimeout.ts

## Question
Session emits token_stored, refresh_token_stored, oauth_tokens_granted with payloads; can an attacker attach a listener through app-reachable API and learn credential state changes or the tokens themselves?

## Target
- File/function: [src/toAbortSignalTimeout.ts](src/toAbortSignalTimeout.ts) - toAbortSignalTimeout (20s request abort signal)
- Entrypoint: PrivyInternal._beforeRequest* signal
- Attacker controls: request duration, abort timing versus storage writes
- Exploit idea: Register listeners and inspect the emitted payloads during toAbortSignalTimeout (20s request abort signal).
- Invariant to test: Session events from src/toAbortSignalTimeout.ts must not carry credential material.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture every event payload during toAbortSignalTimeout (20s request abort signal) and assert none contains a token string.
