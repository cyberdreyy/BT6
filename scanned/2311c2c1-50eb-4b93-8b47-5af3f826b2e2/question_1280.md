# Q1280: method name in envelope but not in body in sign-wallet-request.ts

## Question
The envelope commits to the HTTP method and url, while the operation method (personal_sign, eth_signTransaction) lives in the body; can an attacker swap the body operation while keeping the same signed envelope via SignWalletRequest signer indirection (proxy.signWithUserSigner with accessToken)?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/sign-wallet-request.ts](src/wallet-api/sign-wallet-request.ts) - SignWalletRequest signer indirection (proxy.signWithUserSigner with accessToken)
- Entrypoint: every wallet-api signature
- Attacker controls: which message string is handed to the user signer and what it commits to
- Exploit idea: Reuse a signature across two body variants that share url and method.
- Invariant to test: Signed material must cover the semantic operation, not just the transport.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: reuse the SignWalletRequest signer indirection (proxy.signWithUserSigner with accessToken) signature with a modified body and assert rejection.
