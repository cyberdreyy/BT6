# Q0305: caip2 prefix matching is loose in resolve-refund-address.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/resolve-refund-address.ts](src/action/depositAddress/resolve-refund-address.ts) - resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type, else creates a wallet via WalletCreate
- Entrypoint: deposit-address generation without an explicit refundAddress
- Attacker controls: the caip2 string, the ordering/content of user.linked_accounts, onWalletCreated callback
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type and assert full-reference validation.
