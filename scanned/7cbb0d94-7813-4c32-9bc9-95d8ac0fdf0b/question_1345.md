# Q1345: 20 second abort mid-write in AppApi.ts

## Question
toAbortSignalTimeout aborts requests at 20s; can an attacker time an abort so AppApi.getConfig completes a partial storage mutation while the server-side effect still lands?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Delay the response past the abort and compare local state to server state.
- Invariant to test: An aborted request must leave local session state unchanged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort a refresh mid-flight and assert storage still matches the pre-request state.
