# Q0559: credentialed cross-origin request in cookies.FindSessionCookie

## Question
Does the origin handling on the path through `FindSessionCookie` allow a browser page controlled by the attacker to send credentialed state-changing requests to the Cookie header on any authenticated /v2 route and read the response?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/cookies.go](core/web/cookies.go) -> `FindSessionCookie`
- Entrypoint: the Cookie header on any authenticated /v2 route
- Attacker controls: cookie name casing and attributes (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Serve a page that issues `cookie name casing and attributes` with credentials from an origin echoed back by the CORS logic.
- Invariant to test: credentialed responses may only be exposed to explicitly configured origins
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the origin matcher with attacker-controlled Origin values
