# Q1272: typed data primaryType coerced with String() in smart-wallets.ts

## Question
toWalletApiTypedData sets primary_type via String(typedData.primaryType) and passes types/domain/message straight through; can an attacker supply a primaryType object whose toString names a different struct so smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY signs a payload with a mismatched type?

## Target
- File/function: [src/smart-wallets.ts](src/smart-wallets.ts) - smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY, COINBASE_SMART_WALLET, KERNEL, LIGHT_ACCOUNT, SAFE, THIRDWEB, NEXUS)
- Entrypoint: import {...} from '@privy-io/js-sdk-core/smart-wallets'
- Attacker controls: smart wallet type/version strings used for linking and routing
- Exploit idea: Pass an object with a custom toString as primaryType.
- Invariant to test: The primary type must be a validated key of the supplied types map.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a non-string primaryType to smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY and assert rejection.
