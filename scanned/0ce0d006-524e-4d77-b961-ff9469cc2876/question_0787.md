# Q0787: session_update_action drives local state in Session.ts

## Question
_refreshSession applies set/clear/ignore purely from the response's session_update_action; can an attacker influence that field's handling so tokens are stored under the current user without confirming the subject?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Session.ts](src/Session.ts) - Session.updateWithTokensResponse, destroyLocalState, switchActiveUserId, backfillLegacySession, getOrCreateGuestCredential, tokenIsActive
- Entrypoint: any login/refresh/logout path
- Attacker controls: stored values under privy:token / privy:pat / privy:refresh_token / privy:id-token / privy:active-user / privy:saved-users, cookie twins
- Exploit idea: Return a refresh response with 'set' and a user id different from the active one.
- Invariant to test: Applying a refresh result must verify the returned user matches the session being refreshed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a refresh payload for a different user and assert Session.updateWithTokensResponse refuses to store it.
