# Q0696: clearMfa after refresh sees zero methods in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
MfaApi calls proxy.clearMfa when the refreshed user reports mfa_methods.length === 0; can an attacker cause a stale or partial refresh so RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL clears MFA state while methods still exist?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Return a refresh response with an empty mfa_methods array during an unrelated operation.
- Invariant to test: MFA state may only be cleared when the server authoritatively reports no methods for that user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return an empty mfa_methods for a user that has methods and assert RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL does not clear.
