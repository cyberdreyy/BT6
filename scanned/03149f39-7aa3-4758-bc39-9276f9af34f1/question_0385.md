# Q0385: broadcast through a caller-influenced RPC in getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts

## Question
handleSendTransaction broadcasts with eth_sendRawTransaction through the viem client built by getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain, which prefers rpcUrls.privyWalletOverride then the supportedChains config; can an attacker supply a chain entry through every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call so the signed transaction is sent to an endpoint they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts](src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts) - getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address
- Entrypoint: every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call
- Attacker controls: transaction structure, versioned vs legacy, address-table lookups, duplicate/ordered keys
- Exploit idea: Construct the client with a supportedChains entry carrying an override RPC and observe the broadcast target.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast endpoints must come from a trusted, pinned configuration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a chain with a crafted override to getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address and assert the broadcast target is the trusted endpoint.
