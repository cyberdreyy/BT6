# Q2431: challenge not bound to the stored options in FarcasterV2Api.ts

## Question
Does FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth accept a challenge argument supplied by the caller rather than the one returned by the matching options call, enabling replay of a previously captured assertion?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts) - FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth, authenticate
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcasterV2.authenticate({message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: SIWF message, signature, fid
- Exploit idea: Call the options method, discard the challenge, and log in with an older challenge plus its captured assertion.
- Invariant to test: The challenge submitted must be the one issued for this ceremony.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a stale challenge to FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth and assert it is rejected.
