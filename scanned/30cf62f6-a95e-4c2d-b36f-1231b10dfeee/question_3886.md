# Q3886: recovery access token reused across providers in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
google-drive and icloud recovery both accept recoveryAccessToken; can an attacker present a token from one provider in the other's branch through RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Call recovery with a mismatched provider/token pair.
- Invariant to test: Recovery tokens must be validated against the provider the wallet is bound to.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross provider and token in RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert rejection.
