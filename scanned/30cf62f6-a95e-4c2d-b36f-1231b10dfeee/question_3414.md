# Q3414: is_new_user drives privileged app UI in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
OAuthApi.generateURL merges is_new_user and oauth_tokens from the authenticate response into the returned user; can an attacker influence those fields to make the integrating app treat an existing account as newly created?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Return is_new_user true for an existing account and observe the merged user object.
- Invariant to test: Merged response flags must be derived from the authenticated result, not accepted blindly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert OAuthApi.generateURL derives is_new_user from the server result for the same subject as the stored token.
