# Q2651: role string comparison weakness in helpers.addForbiddenErrorHeaders

## Question
Can an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port obtain a role value that passes the comparison performed on the path through `addForbiddenErrorHeaders` (case, whitespace or prefix handling) even though the stored role is lower-privileged?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/helpers.go](core/web/auth/helpers.go) -> `addForbiddenErrorHeaders`
- Entrypoint: any /v2 or /query error response path
- Attacker controls: unknown IDs and type parameters (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `unknown IDs and type parameters` so the role string persisted or parsed differs in case/whitespace from the constant compared at the gate.
- Invariant to test: role comparison must be exact-match over the canonical role enum
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test feeding role variants ('Admin', ' admin', 'admin\n') through the role check
