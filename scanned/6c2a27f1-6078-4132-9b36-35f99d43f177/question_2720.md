# Q2720: transaction forwarded verbatim to the provider in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
crossApp sendTransaction sends params [transaction] with no field validation; can an attacker submit a transaction through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] whose chainId or value differs from the app's displayed intent?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Submit a transaction with a mismatched chainId.
- Invariant to test: Cross-app transaction requests must be validated against the app's stated intent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a mismatched chainId to crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] and assert rejection.
