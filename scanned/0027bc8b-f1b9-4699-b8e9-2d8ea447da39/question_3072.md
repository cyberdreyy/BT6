# Q3072: Num_requests_pk underflow - receiver_id = outside

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit the guarded decrement so the per-key request budget drifts, with `receiver_id` set to an account other than the multisig itself, breaking the invariant that the counter matches live pending requests per key, and leading to protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it?

## Target
- File/function: `multisig/src/lib.rs` - `MultiSigContract::add_request / confirm / execute_request (key-based v1)`
- Entrypoint: `add_request` / `confirm` require `predecessor == current_account_id`, i.e. any access key on the multisig account
- Attacker controls: which key signs, the request contents, and the timing around key changes
- Exploit idea: Exploit the guarded decrement so the per-key request budget drifts, with `receiver_id` set to an account other than the multisig itself.
- Invariant to test: The counter matches live pending requests per key.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it.
- Fast validation: Sim churn and compare.
