# Q2718: transaction forwarded verbatim to the provider in signMessage.ts

## Question
crossApp sendTransaction sends params [transaction] with no field validation; can an attacker submit a transaction through crossApp signMessage: params [message whose chainId or value differs from the app's displayed intent?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts) - crossApp signMessage: params [message, address], method chosen by isCrossAppWalletSmart
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({user, address, message, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: message bytes/string, address, redirectUrl, provider response payload
- Exploit idea: Submit a transaction with a mismatched chainId.
- Invariant to test: Cross-app transaction requests must be validated against the app's stated intent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a mismatched chainId to crossApp signMessage: params [message and assert rejection.
