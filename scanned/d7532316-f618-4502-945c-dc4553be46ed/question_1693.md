# Q1693: imported wallets bypass the fallback in walletRpc.ts

## Question
getEntropyDetailsFromUser returns the signing account directly when imported is set; can an attacker mark an account object as imported so handleWalletApiRpc derives entropy from an account of their choosing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Pass a hand-built account with imported true.
- Invariant to test: Account flags used for entropy selection must come from server-confirmed data.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass {imported:true} on a crafted account to handleWalletApiRpc and assert re-validation against the session user.
