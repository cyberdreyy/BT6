# Q5755: MFA requirement skipped in api.nextLink

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role complete authentication through `nextLink` at page/size query parameters on /v2 index endpoints without satisfying the WebAuthn step, for example by omitting the assertion field when credentials exist?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/api.go](core/web/api.go) -> `nextLink`
- Entrypoint: page/size query parameters on /v2 index endpoints
- Attacker controls: JSON:API document fields in the request body (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `JSON:API document fields in the request body` with the MFA field absent, null, or an empty object.
- Invariant to test: if the user has registered credentials, authentication must fail without a valid assertion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the login path for users with and without registered credentials
