# Q1341: route group ordering in auth.AuthenticateBySession

## Question
Does the registration order around `AuthenticateBySession` place an unauthenticated group after an authenticated one so a path registered twice is served by the unauthenticated handler for a holder of a restricted API access-key/secret pair?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/auth.go](core/web/auth/auth.go) -> `AuthenticateBySession`
- Entrypoint: any /v2 route wrapped by auth.Authenticate with the session/token/external-initiator authenticator list
- Attacker controls: the session cookie value (attacker capability: a holder of a restricted API access-key/secret pair; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `session cookie value` against paths registered in more than one group.
- Invariant to test: each path may be served by exactly one middleware chain, the most restrictive one
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: route-table test asserting no path is registered in both authenticated and unauthenticated groups
