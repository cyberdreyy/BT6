# Q2506: sandbox flag selects the endpoint in polling.ts

## Question
getTransactionStatus picks the sandbox or prod key from a boolean; can an attacker flip that flag through getDeposit so a sandbox transaction is presented to the user as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Call the status path with useSandbox toggled and inspect what the app reports.
- Invariant to test: Environment selection must be pinned by configuration, not per call.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert getDeposit derives the environment from configuration.
