# Q2109: fetchPrivyRoute is a public escape hatch in keys.ts

## Question
privy.fetchPrivyRoute forwards arbitrary body, params, query and headers with the user's bearer token; can an attacker use token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session to invoke a sensitive route the SDK never exposes?

## Target
- File/function: [src/session/keys.ts](src/session/keys.ts) - token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session
- Entrypoint: Session storage reads and writes
- Attacker controls: the user-id component of every key, multi-user vs legacy null-keyed entries
- Exploit idea: Call fetchPrivyRoute with a privileged route object and a crafted body.
- Invariant to test: Authenticated route access from src/session/keys.ts must be limited to the SDK's own flows.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: call token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session with a wallet-mutating route and assert it is rejected or requires the same guards as the typed API.
