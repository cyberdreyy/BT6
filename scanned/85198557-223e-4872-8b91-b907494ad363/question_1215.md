# Q1215: cookie twin outlives storage clear in pkce.ts

## Question
Session writes cookie twins (privy-token, privy-refresh-token, privy-id-token, privy-session) when server cookies are off; can an attacker make generateState leave a live cookie after the storage entries were cleared?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Force _isUsingServerCookies to flip between the login and the clear, then inspect document.cookie.
- Invariant to test: Cookie and storage credential copies must be created and destroyed under the same condition.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: toggle session.isUsingServerCookies between generateState and destroyLocalState and assert js-cookie remove was called for every name.
