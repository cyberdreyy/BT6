# Q3081: logout does not await server revocation in AuthApi.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout swallows the Logout request error before clearing local state; can an attacker abuse this so the refresh token stays valid server-side while the app reports a completed logout?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/AuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/AuthApi.ts) - AuthApi.logout, AuthApi.email/phone/oauth/siwe/siws/passkey sub-APIs
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.logout(), privy.auth.<method>
- Attacker controls: logout timing, userId passed to mfa.clearMfa, concurrent login calls
- Exploit idea: Make the Logout route fail and then reuse the previously captured refresh token.
- Invariant to test: A completed logout must guarantee server-side revocation or surface the failure.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: fail the Logout route, assert AuthApi.logout surfaces the failure instead of resolving silently.
