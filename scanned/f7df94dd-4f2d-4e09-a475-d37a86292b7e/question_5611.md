# Q5611: Deposit into a contract with no state - many small accounts

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `near_deposit` before `new` has run so the token state is absent or default, spread across many small registered accounts the attacker controls, breaking the invariant that no deposit is accepted before initialisation, and leading to unbacked wNEAR minted / theft of the NEAR backing the token?

## Target
- File/function: `w-near/src/w_near.rs` - `Contract::near_deposit / near_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `near_deposit()` and `near_withdraw(amount)` - payable, any account
- Attacker controls: the attached deposit, the withdrawal amount, its registration state and the receiving account
- Exploit idea: Call `near_deposit` before `new` has run so the token state is absent or default, spread across many small registered accounts the attacker controls.
- Invariant to test: No deposit is accepted before initialisation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unbacked wNEAR minted / theft of the NEAR backing the token.
- Fast validation: Sim a pre-init deposit.
