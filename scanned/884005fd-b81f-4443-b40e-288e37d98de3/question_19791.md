# Q19791: drop_writes verifier acceptance of forbidden package state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a package publish or upgrade that reaches `drop_writes` in `sui-execution/latest/sui-adapter/src/temporary_store.rs` with crafted package bytes, module metadata, type layouts, dependencies, and upgrade parameters, make invalid bytecode or metadata pass validation, and then use the accepted package to create, copy, transfer, or load objects in a way the verifier should forbid?

## Target
- File/function: sui-execution/latest/sui-adapter/src/temporary_store.rs::drop_writes
- Entrypoint: Package publish or package upgrade transaction with crafted Move bytecode, metadata, or dependency state
- Attacker controls: package bytes, module metadata, type layouts, dependencies, and upgrade parameters
- Exploit idea: Look for mismatches between parsing, verification, and runtime assumptions about abilities, signers, ownership, or module linkage.
- Invariant to test: No user-supplied package may be accepted unless verifier and runtime agree that every authority, ownership, and type-safety rule holds.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — verifier bypass chained to unauthorized object creation, transfer, dynamic loading, or fund theft.
- Fast validation: Mutate a local package around the fields consumed here, publish it on a private network, and attempt an unauthorized object or balance transition.
