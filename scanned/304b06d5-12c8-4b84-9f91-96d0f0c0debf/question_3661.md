# Q3661: enrollment success not verified against refresh in MfaPromises.ts

## Question
submitEnrollMfa returns the proxy result and then refreshes; can an attacker make MfaPromises.rootPromise report a successful enrollment that the server never recorded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/MfaPromises.ts](src/client/MfaPromises.ts) - MfaPromises.rootPromise, submitPromise, 'mfaRequired' event
- Entrypoint: privy.mfaPromises listeners in the integrating app
- Attacker controls: who resolves/rejects the shared promise refs, ordering of concurrent operations
- Exploit idea: Return a success from the iframe path while the refresh shows no methods.
- Invariant to test: Reported enrollment success must be confirmed by the refreshed user state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return success with an empty mfa_methods refresh and assert MfaPromises.rootPromise reports failure.
