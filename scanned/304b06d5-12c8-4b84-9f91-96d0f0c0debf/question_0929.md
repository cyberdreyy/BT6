# Q0929: reload flush rejects unrelated operations in resolve.ts

## Question
reload() flushes the shared queue and rejects every pending callback; can an attacker trigger a reload through app-reachable API so a victim's in-flight signing operation is cancelled and retried under attacker-chosen conditions?

## Target
- File/function: [src/crypto/resolve.ts](src/crypto/resolve.ts) - resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto
- Entrypoint: new Privy({crypto})
- Attacker controls: the crypto object the integrator/app passes in, and fallback behaviour when subtle is unavailable
- Exploit idea: Start a signature, call the reload path and observe the rejection and the app's retry.
- Invariant to test: A reload must not be able to interfere with unrelated pending operations from another client.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start a signature, call reload via resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto and assert the operation fails closed with no retry.
