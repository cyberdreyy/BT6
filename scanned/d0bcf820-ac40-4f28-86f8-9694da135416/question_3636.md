# Q3636: link succeeds against the wrong active user in PasskeyApi.ts

## Question
In multi-user mode, can an attacker switch the active user between the request and the refresh inside PasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions so a credential is linked to one account but reported on another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/PasskeyApi.ts](src/client/auth/PasskeyApi.ts) - PasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions, loginWithPasskey, signupWithPasskey, linkWithPasskey, _transformAuthenticationResponseToSnakeCase
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.passkey.loginWithPasskey(response, challenge, relyingParty)
- Attacker controls: relyingParty string, challenge, authenticator response object fields
- Exploit idea: Call the link method and switch active user while the request is in flight.
- Invariant to test: A link operation must apply to and report on a single, unchanged user id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch active user mid-flight and assert PasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions fails rather than reporting success on the new user.
