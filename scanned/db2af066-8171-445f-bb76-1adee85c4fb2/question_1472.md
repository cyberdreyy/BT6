# Q1472: entropyId is just the wallet address in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
getEntropyDetailsFromAccount uses the account address as the entropyId; can an attacker pass an address they merely know through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and cause the iframe to load or recover the wrong wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Call the provider path with a foreign address as entropyId.
- Invariant to test: Entropy identifiers must be validated against the authenticated user's own accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign address into EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert it is rejected before the proxy call.
