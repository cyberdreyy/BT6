# Q3341: base64 and utf8 conversions lose bytes in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
The encoding helpers convert signing payloads through utf8 and base64; can an attacker submit bytes that are not valid UTF-8 so EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') signs a lossy re-encoding of the intended payload?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Pass a payload with lone surrogates or 0xFF bytes and compare round-tripped output.
- Invariant to test: Encoding round trips must be byte-exact for anything that gets signed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: round-trip non-UTF-8 byte sequences through EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') and assert byte equality.
