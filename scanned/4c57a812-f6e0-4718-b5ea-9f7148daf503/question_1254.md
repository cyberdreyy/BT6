# Q1254: access token embedded in every proxy payload in walletCreate.ts

## Question
Every proxy call carries accessToken alongside entropyId and entropyIdVerifier; can an attacker observe or replay one of those payloads through createWalletApiWallet to authorise a wallet operation later?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts) - createWalletApiWallet, create (privy-idempotency-key header)
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({idempotencyKey}) in user-controlled-server-wallets-only mode
- Attacker controls: idempotencyKey string, chainType, repeated concurrent creates
- Exploit idea: Capture a posted payload and replay it into the same interface.
- Invariant to test: Wallet operation payloads must not be replayable outside their original request.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: replay a captured payload into createWalletApiWallet and assert it is rejected.
