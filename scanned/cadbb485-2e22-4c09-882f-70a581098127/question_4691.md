# Q4691: run triggered on a job the caller cannot access in loop_registry.pluginGroup

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role trigger execution through `pluginGroup` at the LOOP plugin registry HTTP routes (discovery, per-plugin metrics and pprof handlers) for a job they were not granted, injecting attacker-chosen input into an oracle report?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/loop_registry.go](core/web/loop_registry.go) -> `pluginGroup`
- Entrypoint: the LOOP plugin registry HTTP routes (discovery, per-plugin metrics and pprof handlers)
- Attacker controls: arbitrary sub-paths under the plugin route (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `arbitrary sub-paths under the plugin route` naming another job's id with an attacker payload.
- Invariant to test: run triggering must be bound to the caller's entitlement for that exact job
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: handler test triggering a foreign job and asserting rejection
