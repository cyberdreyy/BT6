# Q3759: storeCustomerAccessToken accepts a non-string silently in keys.ts

## Question
Passing a non-string to the store methods deletes the entry and emits 'token_cleared'; can an attacker use token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session to clear another session's credential by feeding a non-string through a reachable path?

## Target
- File/function: [src/session/keys.ts](src/session/keys.ts) - token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session
- Entrypoint: Session storage reads and writes
- Attacker controls: the user-id component of every key, multi-user vs legacy null-keyed entries
- Exploit idea: Drive a response with a null token field and observe the deletion path.
- Invariant to test: Credential deletion must be an explicit operation, not the fallback for a malformed value.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass undefined through token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session and assert it raises rather than silently deleting.
