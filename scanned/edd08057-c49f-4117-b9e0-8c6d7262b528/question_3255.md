# Q3255: configuration dump includes secrets in vault_controller.ExportDKGResult

## Question
Does the configuration rendered by `ExportDKGResult` at POST /v2/vault/dkg_results/verify and /v2/vault/dkg_results/export include secrets (DB URL with password, keystore password, API tokens, webhook or bridge credentials) visible to an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin)?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/vault_controller.go](core/web/vault_controller.go) -> `ExportDKGResult`
- Entrypoint: POST /v2/vault/dkg_results/verify and /v2/vault/dkg_results/export
- Attacker controls: the export request parameters (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin); no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Fetch `export request parameters` and grep the response for credential patterns.
- Invariant to test: configuration output must be secret-redacted for every role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: golden-file test asserting the rendered config contains no secret values
