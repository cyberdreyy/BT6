# Q1266: typed data primaryType coerced with String() in isVersionedTransaction.ts

## Question
toWalletApiTypedData sets primary_type via String(typedData.primaryType) and passes types/domain/message straight through; can an attacker supply a primaryType object whose toString names a different struct so isVersionedTransaction ('version' in tx) signs a payload with a mismatched type?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/isVersionedTransaction.ts](src/solana/isVersionedTransaction.ts) - isVersionedTransaction ('version' in tx)
- Entrypoint: Solana provider transaction handling
- Attacker controls: any object shaped to satisfy or defeat the 'version' in tx check
- Exploit idea: Pass an object with a custom toString as primaryType.
- Invariant to test: The primary type must be a validated key of the supplied types map.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a non-string primaryType to isVersionedTransaction ('version' in tx) and assert rejection.
