# Q2292: juplend_withdraw: withdraw round-trip with deposit leaks value across the integration boundary [a-withdraw-amount-at-minimal] [round-trip]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cycle `juplend_withdraw` with a withdraw amount at minimal-share and last-share boundaries so `juplend_withdraw` leaks value when combined with the matching deposit path, violating `Juplend withdraw must burn the right supply position and release only the value actually redeemed to the correct recipient` and causing `Critical: direct theft or phantom redemption`? Focus specifically on withdraw/deposit round-trips around the integration boundary for asymmetric conversions.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/withdraw.rs` / `juplend_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a withdraw amount at minimal-share and last-share boundaries
- Exploit idea: Look for asymmetric conversions or fees where deposit and withdraw are not true economic inverses around edge amounts. Focus specifically on withdraw/deposit round-trips around the integration boundary for asymmetric conversions.
- Invariant to test: Juplend withdraw must burn the right supply position and release only the value actually redeemed to the correct recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or phantom redemption
- Fast validation: Run deposit-then-withdraw and withdraw-then-deposit cycles near boundaries and assert no cycle creates positive attacker value. Run deposit-then-withdraw and withdraw-then-deposit loops and assert no positive attacker value emerges.
