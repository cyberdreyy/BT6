# Q2020: icloud configuration drives recovery choice in EmbeddedWalletApi.ts

## Question
RecoveryICloudApi.getICloudConfiguration returns configuration consumed as trusted; can an attacker influence the returned configuration so EmbeddedWalletApi.create performs recovery against an attacker-chosen record?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts](src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts) - EmbeddedWalletApi.create, add, createSolana, setRecovery, delegateWallets, getProvider, getEthereumProvider, getSolanaProvider, getBitcoinProvider, _load, signWithUserSigner
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({...}) / .setRecovery({...}) / .getEthereumProvider({...})
- Attacker controls: recoveryMethod, password, recoveryKey, recoveryAccessToken, recoverySecretOverride, iCloudRecordNameOverride, entropyId, entropyIdVerifier, wallet object
- Exploit idea: Return a configuration naming a foreign record name and observe the recovery attempt.
- Invariant to test: Recovery targets must be bound to the authenticated user's own records.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign record configuration and assert EmbeddedWalletApi.create refuses to use it.
