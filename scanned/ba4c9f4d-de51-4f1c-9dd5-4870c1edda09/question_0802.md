# Q802: calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount: vault PDA helper and transfer path disagree on the canonical vault [token-amounts-at-one-unit] [family-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit token amounts at one-unit and rounding boundaries so `calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount` and a downstream transfer path disagree on the canonical vault address, violating `pre-fee and post-fee conversions must conserve value across internal accounting and external transfers` and causing `High: phantom internal value or understated debt through fee math drift`? Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: token amounts at one-unit and rounding boundaries
- Exploit idea: A mismatch between utility derivation and runtime constraints can redirect value even if each piece seems locally correct. Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.
- Invariant to test: pre-fee and post-fee conversions must conserve value across internal accounting and external transfers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: phantom internal value or understated debt through fee math drift
- Fast validation: Cross-check helper output against every consuming instruction and assert only one canonical vault/address is ever accepted. Cross-substitute same-interface vaults, mints, and authorities and assert no utility-backed path accepts a foreign family.
