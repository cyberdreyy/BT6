# Q2727: session not invalidated on logout in oidc.generateState

## Question
Does the session id used by an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port at the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled remain accepted by `generateState` after logout, password change or role downgrade?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go](core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go) -> `generateState`
- Entrypoint: the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled
- Attacker controls: state and code parameters (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Reuse `state and code parameters` after each of those events.
- Invariant to test: any credential-changing event must invalidate all existing sessions and tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: integration test reusing a session id after logout/password change
