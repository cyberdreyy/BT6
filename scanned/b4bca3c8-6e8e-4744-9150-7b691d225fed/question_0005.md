# Q0005: Rounded_up/rounded_down pair inverted - 1-yocto amount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker find an amount where `staked_amount_from_num_shares_rounded_up(num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_down(a)) > a`, with `amount = 1` yoctoNEAR so every U256 division truncates, breaking the invariant that converting NEAR to shares and back never yields more NEAR than went in, and leading to direct theft of delegator NEAR from the staking pool?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/internal.rs` - `num_shares_from_staked_amount_* / staked_amount_from_num_shares_*`
- Entrypoint: every value-moving pool method routes through these four helpers
- Attacker controls: the amounts fed into the helpers and the pool state at the time
- Exploit idea: Find an amount where `staked_amount_from_num_shares_rounded_up(num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_down(a)) > a`, with `amount = 1` yoctoNEAR so every U256 division truncates.
- Invariant to test: Converting NEAR to shares and back never yields more NEAR than went in.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of delegator NEAR from the staking pool.
- Fast validation: Quickcheck the round trip over random pool states.
