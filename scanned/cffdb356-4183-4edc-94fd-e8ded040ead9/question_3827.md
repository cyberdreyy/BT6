# Q3827: update_stacks_tip_height: signature slot overwritten so a later rejection is ignored

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `update_stacks_tip_height` (in `stacks-signer/src/monitoring/mod.rs`) via a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only), such that an earlier accept is not undone by a later reject, breaking the invariant that the final response counted == the signer's last decision — leading to stale accept counted?

## Target
- File/function: `stacks-signer/src/monitoring/mod.rs` -> `update_stacks_tip_height`
- Entrypoint: a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only)
- Attacker controls: the full proposed block contents, its claimed tenure/burn view and reorg claim, and the gossiped signer messages
- Exploit idea: an earlier accept is not undone by a later reject
- Invariant to test: the final response counted == the signer's last decision
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - stale accept counted
- Fast validation: test an accept-then-reject sequence
