# Q2474: email canonicalization mismatch in user_controller.Create

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role authenticate through `Create` at /v2/users and /v2/user/* (password change, API token create/delete) as an existing operator by submitting an email that differs in case, unicode normalization or trailing whitespace from the stored one, so lookup succeeds against a different record than the one whose password is checked?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/user_controller.go](core/web/user_controller.go) -> `Create`
- Entrypoint: /v2/users and /v2/user/* (password change, API token create/delete)
- Attacker controls: oldPassword/newPassword fields (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `oldPassword/newPassword fields` in a variant form and compare the record found by lookup with the record whose hash is verified.
- Invariant to test: the identity looked up and the identity whose secret is verified must be the same row
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the user lookup with case/unicode/whitespace email variants
