# Q3664: enrollment success not verified against refresh in MfaPasskeyApi.ts

## Question
submitEnrollMfa returns the proxy result and then refreshes; can an attacker make MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions report a successful enrollment that the server never recorded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaPasskeyApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaPasskeyApi.ts) - MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.passkey.generateAuthenticationOptions(input)
- Attacker controls: relying party and options fields echoed into the passkey ceremony
- Exploit idea: Return a success from the iframe path while the refresh shows no methods.
- Invariant to test: Reported enrollment success must be confirmed by the refreshed user state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return success with an empty mfa_methods refresh and assert MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions reports failure.
