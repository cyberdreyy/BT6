# Q0272: populate then sign is not atomic in EmbeddedWalletProvider.ts

## Question
handleSendTransaction populates, then signs, then broadcasts; can an attacker mutate the transaction object between those steps so the user approves one payload and another is signed via EmbeddedWalletProvider.request?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProvider.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProvider.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProvider.request, ensureChainId, internalSwitchEthereumChain, handleSignTransaction, handleSendTransaction, handlePopulateTransaction, handleEstimateGas, handleSwitchEthereumChain, handleIFrameRpc, handleJsonRpc
- Entrypoint: const p = await privy.embeddedWallet.getEthereumProvider(...); p.request({method, params})
- Attacker controls: method name, params[0] transaction/typed-data/message, chainId field, authorizationList
- Exploit idea: Pass an object with getters that change value between the populate and sign reads.
- Invariant to test: The signed payload must be a frozen snapshot of what was approved.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a self-mutating object to EmbeddedWalletProvider.request and assert the signed payload equals the approved snapshot.
