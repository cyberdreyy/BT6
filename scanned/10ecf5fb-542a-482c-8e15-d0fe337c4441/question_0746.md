# Q0746: polling accepts any order for the address in polling.ts

## Question
waitForDeposit polls GetNextDepositAddressOrder with a deposit address id and an `after` timestamp, then fetches whatever order id comes back; can an attacker cause getDeposit to bind to an order that is not the user's deposit?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Return a next-order response naming a foreign order id.
- Invariant to test: Polled orders must be verified to belong to the requesting deposit and user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign order id in getDeposit's stub and assert it is rejected.
