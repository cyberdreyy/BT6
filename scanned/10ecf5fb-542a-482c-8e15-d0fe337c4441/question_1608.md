# Q1608: access token captured in the signing closure in update-wallet.ts

## Question
The signer closure captures the access token at construction; can an attacker keep a stale closure alive so updateWallet(): signs {version:1 signs using a token belonging to a previous session?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts) - updateWallet(): signs {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id}, body} with NO privy-request-expiry header
- Entrypoint: session signer add/remove
- Attacker controls: the body (additional_signers) and the resulting long-lived authorization signature
- Exploit idea: Obtain the closure, change sessions, then sign.
- Invariant to test: Signing must resolve the current session token at call time.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: change sessions and assert updateWallet(): signs {version:1 refuses to reuse the captured token.
