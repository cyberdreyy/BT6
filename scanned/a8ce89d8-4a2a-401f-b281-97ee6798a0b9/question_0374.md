# Q0374: postMessage target origin is wildcard in walletCreate.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke posts with a '*' target origin; can an attacker whose frame receives that message read the access token, entropyId and signing payload carried in it through createWalletApiWallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts) - createWalletApiWallet, create (privy-idempotency-key header)
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({idempotencyKey}) in user-controlled-server-wallets-only mode
- Attacker controls: idempotencyKey string, chainType, repeated concurrent creates
- Exploit idea: Register a frame that receives the posted message and inspect the JSON payload.
- Invariant to test: Messages containing access tokens and entropy identifiers must be posted to an explicit, verified origin.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: spy on the message poster during createWalletApiWallet and assert the target origin is not '*'.
