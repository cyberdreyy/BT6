# Q2658: user.get returns refreshed foreign user in Token.ts

## Question
UserApi.get returns whatever refreshSession yields; can an attacker interleave a switch so Token.parse returns another user's profile to code that just authorised an action for the first user?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Switch active user during the in-flight refresh and inspect the returned user.
- Invariant to test: A user read must be atomic with respect to active-user changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch users mid-refresh and assert Token.parse throws rather than returning the other profile.
