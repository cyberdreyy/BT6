# Q2097: nonce reuse across two logins in SiweApi.ts

## Question
Can an attacker reuse a nonce previously issued by init()/fetchNonce for the same address to authenticate a second time from a different device or context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts](src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts) - SiweApi.init, loginWithSiwe, linkWithSiwe, unlinkWallet, generateSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siwe.init(wallet, domain, uri) then loginWithSiwe(signature, wallet, message)
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, chainId, walletClientType, connectorType, full message override, signature
- Exploit idea: Capture the nonce, complete a login, then replay message and signature.
- Invariant to test: Each issued nonce must be single-use for SiweApi.init.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: complete a login and then replay the same message/signature and assert the second attempt fails.
