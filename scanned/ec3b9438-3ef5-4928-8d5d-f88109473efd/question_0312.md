# Q0312: caip2 prefix matching is loose in moonpay.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/moonpay.ts](src/funding/moonpay.ts) - isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay, chainToMoonpayCurrency (defaults to ETH_ETHEREUM on unknown chain), fundingMethodToMoonpayPaymentMethod
- Entrypoint: MoonPay funding parameter construction
- Attacker controls: chainId and asset arguments
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay and assert full-reference validation.
