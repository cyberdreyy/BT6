# Q3666: enrollment success not verified against refresh in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
submitEnrollMfa returns the proxy result and then refreshes; can an attacker make RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL report a successful enrollment that the server never recorded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Return a success from the iframe path while the refresh shows no methods.
- Invariant to test: Reported enrollment success must be confirmed by the refreshed user state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return success with an empty mfa_methods refresh and assert RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL reports failure.
