# Q2076: cpi_juplend_deposit: deposit accounting mints too much internal value [replay-of-a-valid-cpi] [net-value]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `juplend_deposit` with replay of a valid CPI context against another user or bank so `cpi_juplend_deposit` credits more internal value than the external integration actually received, breaking `Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly` and causing `Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `cpi_juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: replay of a valid CPI context against another user or bank
- Exploit idea: Audit share conversions, fee-adjusted transfers, and rounding around CPI deposit accounting. Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.
- Invariant to test: Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Compare external protocol balances against marginfi internal balances after adversarial deposit amounts and assert no phantom value is minted. Compare user debit, external protocol credit, and internal asset increase and assert all three line up exactly.
