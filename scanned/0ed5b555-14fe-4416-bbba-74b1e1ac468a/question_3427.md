# Q3427: mightHaveServerCookies gates refresh in Session.ts

## Question
hasRefreshCredentials returns true when any privy-session cookie is present; can an attacker set that marker cookie so Session.updateWithTokensResponse attempts a refresh flow that clears or replaces valid local state?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Session.ts](src/Session.ts) - Session.updateWithTokensResponse, destroyLocalState, switchActiveUserId, backfillLegacySession, getOrCreateGuestCredential, tokenIsActive
- Entrypoint: any login/refresh/logout path
- Attacker controls: stored values under privy:token / privy:pat / privy:refresh_token / privy:id-token / privy:active-user / privy:saved-users, cookie twins
- Exploit idea: Set a privy-session cookie without real credentials and trigger a refresh.
- Invariant to test: Refresh eligibility must not depend on an unauthenticated marker cookie.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: set only the marker cookie and assert Session.updateWithTokensResponse does not destroy local state on the resulting failure.
