# Q2003: appId or clientId swapped at construction in Privy.ts

## Question
Privy's constructor accepts appId, clientId, baseUrl, storage and crypto; can an attacker in the page reach Privy constructor with substituted options so requests are signed and stored under a different app namespace?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Construct a second client with a different appId sharing the same storage and observe key collisions.
- Invariant to test: Storage namespacing must prevent one app id's session from being consumed by another.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two clients with different appIds over one Storage and assert no key collisions.
