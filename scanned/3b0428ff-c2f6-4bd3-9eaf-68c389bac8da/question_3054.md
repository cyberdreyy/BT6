# Q3054: solana usdc mint empty for testnet in generate.ts

## Question
SolanaUsdcAddressMap has an empty string for testnet while getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster throws for it; can an attacker reach the map-based path through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain so an empty mint address is used as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Select testnet and follow both code paths.
- Invariant to test: Missing mint data must fail closed on every path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: select testnet through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain and assert both paths error.
