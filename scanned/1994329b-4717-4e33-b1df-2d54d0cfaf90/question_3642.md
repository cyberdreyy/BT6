# Q3642: link succeeds against the wrong active user in TelegramApi.ts

## Question
In multi-user mode, can an attacker switch the active user between the request and the refresh inside TelegramApi.authenticate so a credential is linked to one account but reported on another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts](src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts) - TelegramApi.authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.telegram.authenticate({telegramWebAppData, telegramAuthResult, captchaToken, mode})
- Attacker controls: telegram_web_app_data blob, telegram_auth_result, captcha_token, mode
- Exploit idea: Call the link method and switch active user while the request is in flight.
- Invariant to test: A link operation must apply to and report on a single, unchanged user id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch active user mid-flight and assert TelegramApi.authenticate fails rather than reporting success on the new user.
