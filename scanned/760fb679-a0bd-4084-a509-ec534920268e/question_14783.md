# Q14783: variant_instantiation_handles type or layout confusion

## Question
Can a crafted package publish or transaction reach `variant_instantiation_handles` with attacker-controlled package bytes, module metadata, type layouts, dependencies, and upgrade parameters and make the system interpret the same bytes as two incompatible types, objects, or ownership states, leading to unauthorized transfer, destruction, or custody escape?

## Target
- File/function: external-crates/move/crates/move-binary-format/src/file_format.rs::variant_instantiation_handles
- Entrypoint: Package publish or package upgrade transaction with crafted Move bytecode, metadata, or dependency state
- Attacker controls: package bytes, module metadata, type layouts, dependencies, and upgrade parameters
- Exploit idea: Search for deserialized layout assumptions that are weaker than runtime type or ownership expectations.
- Invariant to test: A serialized object, value, or type layout must have exactly one valid interpretation throughout verification and execution.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical — state corruption or loss of funds through type confusion in package verification or runtime loading.
- Fast validation: Construct mutated layouts or generic instantiations locally and check whether verification and runtime disagree on the same value.
