# Q3145: json body serialised twice in raw-sign.ts

## Question
PrivyInternal.fetch JSON.stringifies the body while the signature covers the pre-serialisation object; can an attacker exploit serialisation differences (key order, unicode escaping, number formatting) so rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign signs one byte string and sends another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts](src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts) - rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign
- Entrypoint: raw-hash signing on an extended-chains wallet
- Attacker controls: the hash/params body fields and wallet_id
- Exploit idea: Include unicode, large numbers and key orders that differ between canonicalize and JSON.stringify.
- Invariant to test: Signed and transmitted encodings must be byte-identical.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert canonicalize output and the transmitted body are byte-equal for rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign.
