# Q4162: undecodable responses counted as valid in workflow_metadata_handler.Authorize

## Question
Does `Authorize` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request count undecodable or error responses toward success, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests force a result with fewer honest contributions?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `Authorize`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: authorization key material presented (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Trigger the mixed-response branch with `authorization key material presented`.
- Invariant to test: only successfully decoded, verified responses may count
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test with mixed decodable/undecodable responses
