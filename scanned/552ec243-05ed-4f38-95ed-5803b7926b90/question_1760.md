# Q1760: parse_pox_addr: signerdb write failure treated as success

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `parse_pox_addr` (in `stacks-signer/src/cli.rs`) via a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only), such that a failed persist is not detected, so the signer waits forever, breaking the invariant that a persisted decision == an acknowledged durable write — leading to liveness / re-sign?

## Target
- File/function: `stacks-signer/src/cli.rs` -> `parse_pox_addr`
- Entrypoint: a BlockProposal from a miner slot the attacker won (their own BTC), plus signer/StackerDB messages they gossip into the signer's stream (minority weight only)
- Attacker controls: the full proposed block contents, its claimed tenure/burn view and reorg claim, and the gossiped signer messages
- Exploit idea: a failed persist is not detected, so the signer waits forever
- Invariant to test: a persisted decision == an acknowledged durable write
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - liveness / re-sign
- Fast validation: test a failing signerdb write
