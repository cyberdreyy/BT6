# Q3207: key builder collides on crafted user ids in Session.ts

## Question
Token storage keys are built by string interpolation of the user id; can an attacker obtain or seed a user id containing ':' so keys for two users collide?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Session.ts](src/Session.ts) - Session.updateWithTokensResponse, destroyLocalState, switchActiveUserId, backfillLegacySession, getOrCreateGuestCredential, tokenIsActive
- Entrypoint: any login/refresh/logout path
- Attacker controls: stored values under privy:token / privy:pat / privy:refresh_token / privy:id-token / privy:active-user / privy:saved-users, cookie twins
- Exploit idea: Store sessions for ids 'a' and 'a:token' style values and compare resulting keys.
- Invariant to test: Key construction in src/Session.ts must be injective over user ids.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert Session.updateWithTokensResponse produces distinct keys for ids that differ only by separators.
