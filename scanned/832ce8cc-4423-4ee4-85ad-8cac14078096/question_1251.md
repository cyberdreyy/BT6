# Q1251: access token embedded in every proxy payload in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
Every proxy call carries accessToken alongside entropyId and entropyIdVerifier; can an attacker observe or replay one of those payloads through EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') to authorise a wallet operation later?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Capture a posted payload and replay it into the same interface.
- Invariant to test: Wallet operation payloads must not be replayable outside their original request.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: replay a captured payload into EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') and assert it is rejected.
