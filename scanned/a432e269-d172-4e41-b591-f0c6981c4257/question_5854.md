# Q5854: shard selection redirects execution in workflow_metadata_handler.syncMetadata

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests influence the shard/DON chosen by `syncMetadata` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request so their request executes on a shard that does not enforce the same authorization?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `syncMetadata`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request` with crafted shard-selecting fields.
- Invariant to test: shard selection must not alter the authorization decision
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test asserting identical authorization across shards
