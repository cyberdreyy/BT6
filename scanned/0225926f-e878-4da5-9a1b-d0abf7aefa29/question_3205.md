# Q3205: clearMfa keyed by caller-supplied userId in SmartWalletApi.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout forwards opts.userId to mfa.clearMfa; can an attacker pass another user's id and clear MFA state that is not theirs?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts](src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts) - SmartWalletApi.init, link, generateSmartWalletSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.smartWallet.init(wallet) then link(message, signature, type, version)
- Attacker controls: message override, signature, smart_wallet_type, smart_wallet_version, chainId
- Exploit idea: Call logout with a foreign userId and observe the proxy clearMfa invocation.
- Invariant to test: MFA state may only be cleared for the currently authenticated user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call SmartWalletApi.init with a foreign userId and assert clearMfa is called with the session's own user id or not at all.
