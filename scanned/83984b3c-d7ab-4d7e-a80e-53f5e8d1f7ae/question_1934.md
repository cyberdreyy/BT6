# Q1934: getWallet result drives the next write in rpc.ts

## Question
getWallet returns additional_signers that addSessionSigners concatenates and writes back; can an attacker influence the read so rpc(): builds {version:1 writes back a signer set containing an entry they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Return an extra signer in the read response and observe it persisted by the subsequent write.
- Invariant to test: Read-modify-write of authorization state must validate every entry before rewriting.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: inject an extra signer into rpc(): builds {version:1's read stub and assert it is not written back.
