# Q1159: fee payer signature parity inference in client.ts

## Question
toFeePayerSignature derives yParity from v-27 when yParity is absent; can an attacker supply a v value that yields a wrong parity accepted by SolanaClient.invokeRpc?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Send v values such as 0, 1, 35 and 36 and inspect the derived parity.
- Invariant to test: Signature parity must be derived unambiguously or rejected.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test v/yParity inputs through SolanaClient.invokeRpc.
