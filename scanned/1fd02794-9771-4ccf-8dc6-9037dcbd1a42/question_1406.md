# Q1406: abort signal supplied by the caller in polling.ts

## Question
poll checks a caller-supplied AbortSignal; can an attacker abort getDeposit at a chosen moment so the app treats a completed deposit as aborted and issues a duplicate?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Abort right after the funds land.
- Invariant to test: Abort must not change the recorded outcome of a settled deposit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort getDeposit after settlement and assert the state reflects settlement.
