# Q0558: credentialed cross-origin request in helpers.jsonAPIError

## Question
Does the origin handling on the path through `jsonAPIError` allow a browser page controlled by the attacker to send credentialed state-changing requests to any /v2 or /query error response path and read the response?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/helpers.go](core/web/auth/helpers.go) -> `jsonAPIError`
- Entrypoint: any /v2 or /query error response path
- Attacker controls: malformed JSON bodies (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Serve a page that issues `malformed JSON bodies` with credentials from an origin echoed back by the CORS logic.
- Invariant to test: credentialed responses may only be exposed to explicitly configured origins
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the origin matcher with attacker-controlled Origin values
