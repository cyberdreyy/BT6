# Q3062: solana usdc mint empty for testnet in moonpay.ts

## Question
SolanaUsdcAddressMap has an empty string for testnet while getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster throws for it; can an attacker reach the map-based path through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay so an empty mint address is used as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/moonpay.ts](src/funding/moonpay.ts) - isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay, chainToMoonpayCurrency (defaults to ETH_ETHEREUM on unknown chain), fundingMethodToMoonpayPaymentMethod
- Entrypoint: MoonPay funding parameter construction
- Attacker controls: chainId and asset arguments
- Exploit idea: Select testnet and follow both code paths.
- Invariant to test: Missing mint data must fail closed on every path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: select testnet through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay and assert both paths error.
