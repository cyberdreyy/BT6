# Q5976: path normalization mismatch in middleware.Open

## Question
Can an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port reach a protected handler through `Open` using a path variant (trailing slash, double slash, encoded segment) that the router matches but the role middleware does not?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/middleware.go](core/web/middleware.go) -> `Open`
- Entrypoint: GET on any static asset path served by ServeGzippedAssets/GzipFileServer
- Attacker controls: percent-encoded and dot-segment path bytes (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `percent-encoded and dot-segment path bytes` in normalized and non-normalized forms.
- Invariant to test: route matching and middleware application must operate on the same normalized path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: route test comparing handler execution across path variants
