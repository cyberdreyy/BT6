# Q0311: caip2 prefix matching is loose in coinbase.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/coinbase.ts](src/funding/coinbase.ts) - getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId, sessionToken, presetCryptoAmount, defaultNetwork, defaultAsset, partnerUserId), toCoinbaseBlockchainFromChainId, toCoinbaseAssetId, ASSET_ID_MAP, formatAmount('.'-prefix fix)
- Entrypoint: the on-ramp URL handed to the user's browser
- Attacker controls: amount string, chainId, asset, experience, and the session token/partner id echoed into the URL
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId and assert full-reference validation.
