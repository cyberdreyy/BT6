# Q3598: cross-app login caches tokens before user confirmation in signMessage.ts

## Question
loginWithCrossAppAuth calls updateOnCrossAppAuthentication with the oauth_tokens as soon as the exchange returns; can an attacker cause a token to be cached for a provider app the user never approved through crossApp signMessage: params [message?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts) - crossApp signMessage: params [message, address], method chosen by isCrossAppWalletSmart
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({user, address, message, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: message bytes/string, address, redirectUrl, provider response payload
- Exploit idea: Return oauth_tokens for a different provider in the exchange response.
- Invariant to test: Cached provider tokens must match the provider the user authorised.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign provider token to crossApp signMessage: params [message and assert it is not cached.
