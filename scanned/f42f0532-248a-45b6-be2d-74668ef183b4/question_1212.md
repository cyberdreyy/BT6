# Q1212: prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts panics on attacker-reachable input (prioritization_fee.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts` in `runtime/src/prioritization_fee.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/prioritization_fee.rs` -> `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts()` (around line 212)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Reach `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
