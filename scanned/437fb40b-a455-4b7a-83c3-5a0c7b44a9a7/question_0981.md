# Q0981: create-on-login policy evaluated client-side in getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet.ts

## Question
getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet / getUserEmbeddedWallet: first account with wallet_index === 0 decides whether to provision a wallet from the createOnLogin setting and the user's existing accounts; can an attacker influence that evaluation so a wallet is created (or skipped) against the app's policy?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet.ts](src/utils/getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet.ts) - getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet / getUserEmbeddedWallet: first account with wallet_index === 0
- Entrypoint: entropy resolution, root-wallet selection, create-on-login checks
- Attacker controls: the user object's linked_accounts array contents and ordering
- Exploit idea: Present linked-account sets that flip each branch.
- Invariant to test: Provisioning policy must be evaluated against server-confirmed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: enumerate account sets through getUserEmbeddedEthereumWallet / getUserEmbeddedWallet: first account with wallet_index === 0 and assert branch correctness.
