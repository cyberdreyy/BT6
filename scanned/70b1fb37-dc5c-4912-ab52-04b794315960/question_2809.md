# Q2809: psbt forwarded without inspection in client.ts

## Question
signTransaction forwards the psbt argument verbatim to the iframe; can an attacker submit a psbt through SolanaClient.invokeRpc whose outputs differ from what the app displayed?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Submit a psbt with an added output and observe no client-side checks.
- Invariant to test: The SDK must surface or verify the outputs it asks the user to sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert SolanaClient.invokeRpc extracts and exposes psbt outputs for confirmation.
