# Q1261: metrics token comparison in router.NewRouter

## Question
Can an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port authenticate to the metrics endpoint gated near `NewRouter` by exploiting a weak or non-constant-time token comparison, obtaining node internals used to plan key theft?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/router.go](core/web/router.go) -> `NewRouter`
- Entrypoint: any route registered by NewRouter/v2Routes/sessionRoutes/loopRoutes on the node API listener (default :6688)
- Attacker controls: Authorization / X-API-KEY headers (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Probe `Authorization / X-API-KEY headers` with prefix-varied tokens.
- Invariant to test: metrics auth must use constant-time comparison of the full token
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: unit test on the metrics auth helper with near-miss tokens
