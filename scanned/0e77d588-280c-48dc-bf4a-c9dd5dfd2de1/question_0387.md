# Q0387: broadcast through a caller-influenced RPC in offchain-message.ts

## Question
handleSendTransaction broadcasts with eth_sendRawTransaction through the viem client built by getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain, which prefers rpcUrls.privyWalletOverride then the supportedChains config; can an attacker supply a chain entry through off-chain message construction for Solana signing so the signed transaction is sent to an endpoint they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/offchain-message.ts](src/solana/offchain-message.ts) - deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes), buildSolanaOffchainMessage (255 + 'solana offchain' preamble, 1232 max), parseSolanaOffchainMessage
- Entrypoint: off-chain message construction for Solana signing
- Attacker controls: origin/domain string, message contents and length, raw bytes handed to the parser
- Exploit idea: Construct the client with a supportedChains entry carrying an override RPC and observe the broadcast target.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast endpoints must come from a trusted, pinned configuration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a chain with a crafted override to deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes) and assert the broadcast target is the trusted endpoint.
