# Q0260: timeout resolves the root promise in EmbeddedWalletApi.ts

## Question
withMfa rejects the root MFA promise on timeout but the loop continues with the next attempt; can an attacker use a 300000ms timeout window in EmbeddedWalletApi.create to keep an operation alive after the user cancelled?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts](src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts) - EmbeddedWalletApi.create, add, createSolana, setRecovery, delegateWallets, getProvider, getEthereumProvider, getSolanaProvider, getBitcoinProvider, _load, signWithUserSigner
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({...}) / .setRecovery({...}) / .getEthereumProvider({...})
- Attacker controls: recoveryMethod, password, recoveryKey, recoveryAccessToken, recoverySecretOverride, iCloudRecordNameOverride, entropyId, entropyIdVerifier, wallet object
- Exploit idea: Let the MFA wait time out and observe the retry behaviour and promise state.
- Invariant to test: A cancelled or timed-out MFA challenge must terminate the operation, not roll to another attempt.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: force a timeout in EmbeddedWalletApi.create and assert the operation rejects immediately.
