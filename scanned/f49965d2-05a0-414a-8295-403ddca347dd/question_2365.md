# Q2365: off-chain domain truncated to 32 bytes in getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts

## Question
deriveSolanaApplicationDomain copies the first 32 UTF-8 bytes of the origin into the application domain; can an attacker register a longer origin that collides with the victim's origin after truncation so getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address produces messages the victim's verifier accepts?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts](src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts) - getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address
- Entrypoint: every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call
- Attacker controls: transaction structure, versioned vs legacy, address-table lookups, duplicate/ordered keys
- Exploit idea: Find two origins sharing a 32-byte prefix and compare derived domains.
- Invariant to test: The application domain must be collision-resistant over origins.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert two distinct origins never produce the same domain from getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address.
