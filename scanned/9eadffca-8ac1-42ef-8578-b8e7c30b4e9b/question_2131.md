# Q2131: signer list concatenated without validation in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
addSessionSigners concatenates the caller's signers array onto the existing list with no dedupe or ownership check; can an attacker add a signer key they control through EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*')?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Call the add path with an attacker-held signer entry.
- Invariant to test: Session signers must be validated and require explicit user approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an arbitrary signer to EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') and assert an approval gate is enforced.
