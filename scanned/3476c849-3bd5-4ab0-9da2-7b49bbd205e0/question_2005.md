# Q2005: appId or clientId swapped at construction in AppApi.ts

## Question
Privy's constructor accepts appId, clientId, baseUrl, storage and crypto; can an attacker in the page reach AppApi.getConfig with substituted options so requests are signed and stored under a different app namespace?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Construct a second client with a different appId sharing the same storage and observe key collisions.
- Invariant to test: Storage namespacing must prevent one app id's session from being consumed by another.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two clients with different appIds over one Storage and assert no key collisions.
