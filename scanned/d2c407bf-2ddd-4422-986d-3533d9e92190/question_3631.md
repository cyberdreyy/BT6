# Q3631: link succeeds against the wrong active user in AuthApi.ts

## Question
In multi-user mode, can an attacker switch the active user between the request and the refresh inside AuthApi.logout so a credential is linked to one account but reported on another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/AuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/AuthApi.ts) - AuthApi.logout, AuthApi.email/phone/oauth/siwe/siws/passkey sub-APIs
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.logout(), privy.auth.<method>
- Attacker controls: logout timing, userId passed to mfa.clearMfa, concurrent login calls
- Exploit idea: Call the link method and switch active user while the request is in flight.
- Invariant to test: A link operation must apply to and report on a single, unchanged user id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch active user mid-flight and assert AuthApi.logout fails rather than reporting success on the new user.
