# Q1734: asset id map lookup unchecked in generate.ts

## Question
toCoinbaseAssetId falls back to 'ETH' for anything that is not USDC on known chains, and the asset id map is keyed by symbol; can an attacker choose a chain/asset pair through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain so the on-ramp buys a different asset than the user selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chain with asset USDC and inspect the resulting defaultAsset.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported asset/chain pairs must be rejected, never defaulted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass unsupported pairs to generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain and assert rejection.
