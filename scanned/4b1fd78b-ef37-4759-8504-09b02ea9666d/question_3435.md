# Q3435: mightHaveServerCookies gates refresh in AppApi.ts

## Question
hasRefreshCredentials returns true when any privy-session cookie is present; can an attacker set that marker cookie so AppApi.getConfig attempts a refresh flow that clears or replaces valid local state?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Set a privy-session cookie without real credentials and trigger a refresh.
- Invariant to test: Refresh eligibility must not depend on an unauthenticated marker cookie.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: set only the marker cookie and assert AppApi.getConfig does not destroy local state on the resulting failure.
