# Q2923: signature not bound to the access token in generate-authorization-signature.ts

## Question
The envelope commits to app id and expiry but not to the session token used to authenticate; can an attacker present a signature from generateAuthorizationSignature: canonicalize(payload) -> utf8 -> base64 together with a different session token?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/generate-authorization-signature.ts](src/wallet-api/generate-authorization-signature.ts) - generateAuthorizationSignature: canonicalize(payload) -> utf8 -> base64, or raw base64 for Uint8Array
- Entrypoint: every TEE wallet-api request signed with the user signer
- Attacker controls: the payload object fields that reach canonicalize, and any field canonicalize drops
- Exploit idea: Pair a captured signature with another token.
- Invariant to test: Authorization signatures must be bound to the session that produced them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: cross a captured signature with another session and assert rejection.
