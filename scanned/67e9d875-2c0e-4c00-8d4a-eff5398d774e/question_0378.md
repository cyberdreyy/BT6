# Q0378: postMessage target origin is wildcard in entropy.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke posts with a '*' target origin; can an attacker whose frame receives that message read the access token, entropyId and signing payload carried in it through getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana)?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/entropy.ts](src/utils/entropy.ts) - getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana), getEntropyDetailsFromAccount (address as entropyId + <chain>-address-verifier)
- Entrypoint: provider construction for any embedded wallet
- Attacker controls: which linked account is passed as signingAccount, wallet_index ordering, imported flag
- Exploit idea: Register a frame that receives the posted message and inspect the JSON payload.
- Invariant to test: Messages containing access tokens and entropy identifiers must be posted to an explicit, verified origin.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: spy on the message poster during getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana) and assert the target origin is not '*'.
