# Q0817: bigint and undefined fields collapse the cache key in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
The cache key is built with JSON.stringify, which drops undefined values and functions; can an attacker craft two different payloads that produce the same key inside toWalletApiTypedData (types?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Pass payloads differing only by an undefined field and observe the shared cache entry.
- Invariant to test: Cache keys must be injective over the payloads they represent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert toWalletApiTypedData (types produces different keys for payloads differing only in undefined-valued fields.
