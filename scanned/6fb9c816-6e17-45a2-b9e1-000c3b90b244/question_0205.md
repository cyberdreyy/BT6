# Q205: cpi::check_account_infos — PDA seed forgery

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a deployed SBPF program issuing a CPI, reach `cpi::check_account_infos` and pass signer seeds that derive a PDA owned by another program so the CPI signs as that PDA, so that the invariant "PDA signing requires the true seeds under the actually-owning program id" is violated, leading to Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/cpi.rs` -> `check_account_infos`
- Entrypoint: a deployed SBPF program issuing a CPI
- Attacker controls: the seed arrays passed to invoke_signed
- Exploit idea: Pass signer seeds that derive a PDA owned by another program so the CPI signs as that PDA.
- Invariant to test: PDA signing requires the true seeds under the actually-owning program id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds — Critical
- Fast validation: write a program-test invoking invoke_signed with the crafted metas/seeds and assert the privilege is not escalated.
