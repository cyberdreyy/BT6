# Q2886: remove_connection answers at the wrong slot, fork, or commitment (qos.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `remove_connection` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/qos.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make the packets marked signature-verified disagree with the packets whose signatures were actually checked, so that the invariant "Finalized answers derive only from rooted slots on the canonical fork." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/qos.rs` -> `remove_connection()` (around line 49)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Get `remove_connection` to answer a finalized-commitment query from unrooted or wrong-fork state, so an integrator credits value on state that can still be rolled back.
- Invariant to test: Finalized answers derive only from rooted slots on the canonical fork.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Query across a fork with a slot that is confirmed but not rooted; assert the finalized response excludes it.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
