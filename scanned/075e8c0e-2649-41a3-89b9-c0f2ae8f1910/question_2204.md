# Q2204: Many pings in one block - last block of an epoch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `ping` repeatedly inside one block so `last_epoch_height` short-circuits some paths but not the balance bookkeeping, in the last block of an epoch so the state change lands before the reward is distributed, breaking the invariant that repeated pings in one block are idempotent, and leading to protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/internal.rs` - `StakingContract::internal_ping / ping / on_stake_action`
- Entrypoint: `ping()` - callable by anyone; also reached from `deposit`, `stake`, `unstake`, `withdraw`
- Attacker controls: when the ping happens, how much NEAR is sitting on the account, and whether a stake action is in flight
- Exploit idea: Call `ping` repeatedly inside one block so `last_epoch_height` short-circuits some paths but not the balance bookkeeping, in the last block of an epoch so the state change lands before the reward is distributed.
- Invariant to test: Repeated pings in one block are idempotent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it.
- Fast validation: Sim repeated pings and diff the state.
