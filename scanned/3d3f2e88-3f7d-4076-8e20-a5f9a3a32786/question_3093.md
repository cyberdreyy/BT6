# Q3093: logout does not await server revocation in CustomProviderApi.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout swallows the Logout request error before clearing local state; can an attacker abuse this so the refresh token stays valid server-side while the app reports a completed logout?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts](src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts) - CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken, linkWithToken
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.customProvider.syncWithToken(token, opts, mode)
- Attacker controls: the third-party JWT string, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Make the Logout route fail and then reuse the previously captured refresh token.
- Invariant to test: A completed logout must guarantee server-side revocation or surface the failure.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: fail the Logout route, assert CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken surfaces the failure instead of resolving silently.
