# Q3226: set-recovery runs after _load succeeded in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
setRecovery loads the wallet then changes recovery; can an attacker interrupt between load and set so RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL rebinds recovery for a different wallet than the one loaded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Swap the wallet object between the two awaits.
- Invariant to test: Load and rebind must operate on the same wallet identity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: mutate the wallet between the awaits of RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert the operation aborts.
