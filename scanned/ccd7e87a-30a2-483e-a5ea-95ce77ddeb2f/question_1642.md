# Q1642: retry amplification per request in response_cache.newResponseCache

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests make one accepted request at the gateway response cache serving repeated user trigger requests cause repeated node work through the retry logic near `newResponseCache`, multiplying DON execution per unit of entitlement?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/response_cache.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/response_cache.go) -> `newResponseCache`
- Entrypoint: the gateway response cache serving repeated user trigger requests
- Attacker controls: status codes returned by the DON (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `status codes returned by the DON` that never reaches a terminal state.
- Invariant to test: retries must be bounded per request and counted against the caller's quota
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test counting node messages produced by one user request
