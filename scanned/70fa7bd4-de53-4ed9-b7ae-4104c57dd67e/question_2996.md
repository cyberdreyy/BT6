# Q2996: accounts_db::hash_account_helper — bucket-map hash collision

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction, reach `accounts_db::hash_account_helper` and choose account keys that collide in bucket_map so index_entry probing loops or misresolves, so that the invariant "bucket_map resolves each key to its own entry in bounded probes" is violated, leading to Liveness / DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs` -> `hash_account_helper`
- Entrypoint: accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction
- Attacker controls: the pubkeys of accounts it creates
- Exploit idea: Choose account keys that collide in bucket_map so index_entry probing loops or misresolves.
- Invariant to test: bucket_map resolves each key to its own entry in bounded probes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / DoS — High
- Fast validation: write an accounts-db test storing/reloading the crafted account and asserting index==storage and no panic.
