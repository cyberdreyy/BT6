# Q1741: asset id map lookup unchecked in coinbase.ts

## Question
toCoinbaseAssetId falls back to 'ETH' for anything that is not USDC on known chains, and the asset id map is keyed by symbol; can an attacker choose a chain/asset pair through getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId so the on-ramp buys a different asset than the user selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/coinbase.ts](src/funding/coinbase.ts) - getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId, sessionToken, presetCryptoAmount, defaultNetwork, defaultAsset, partnerUserId), toCoinbaseBlockchainFromChainId, toCoinbaseAssetId, ASSET_ID_MAP, formatAmount('.'-prefix fix)
- Entrypoint: the on-ramp URL handed to the user's browser
- Attacker controls: amount string, chainId, asset, experience, and the session token/partner id echoed into the URL
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chain with asset USDC and inspect the resulting defaultAsset.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported asset/chain pairs must be rejected, never defaulted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass unsupported pairs to getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId and assert rejection.
