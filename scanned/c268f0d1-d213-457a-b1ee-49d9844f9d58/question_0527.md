# Q527: find_bank_vault_pda: fee-adjusted amount conversion can be abused across CPI boundaries [a-withdraw-after-config-or] [amount-domain]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `kamino_withdraw` with a withdraw after config or metadata changes on a sibling bank so `find_bank_vault_pda` applies fee-adjusted amount conversion inconsistently across CPI boundaries, violating `every value-moving integration path must use the exact canonical bank vault PDA for its bank and vault family` and causing `Critical: direct theft through vault redirection`? Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `find_bank_vault_pda`
- Entrypoint: `kamino_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a withdraw after config or metadata changes on a sibling bank
- Exploit idea: Audit helpers that convert pre-fee and post-fee token amounts, especially when deposits/withdrawals bridge internal and external accounting. Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.
- Invariant to test: every value-moving integration path must use the exact canonical bank vault PDA for its bank and vault family
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft through vault redirection
- Fast validation: Fuzz fee-bearing amount conversions around boundary values and assert the internal/external ledgers reconcile exactly. Fuzz one-unit and boundary values and assert debited, credited, and accounted amounts all reconcile exactly.
