# Q3235: directory metacharacter injection in identity lookup in reaper.Work

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role inject filter metacharacters through `Work` at any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change so the identity query matches an administrator entry instead of the submitted account?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go](core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go) -> `Work`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change
- Attacker controls: timing of requests relative to session/token lifetime (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `timing of requests relative to session/token lifetime` containing filter/DN metacharacters.
- Invariant to test: all externally supplied values must be escaped before entering the identity query
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test over the query builder with metacharacter payloads
