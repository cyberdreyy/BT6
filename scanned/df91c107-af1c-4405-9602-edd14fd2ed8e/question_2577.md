# Q2577: wallet-api rpc method echo check only in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
walletRpc verifies the response method name equals the requested one but not the wallet or params; can an attacker return a signature produced for another payload through toWalletApiTypedData (types?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Return a response whose method matches but whose signature is for a different message.
- Invariant to test: A signing response must be bound to the exact request that produced it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a mismatched signature from toWalletApiTypedData (types's route and assert it is rejected.
