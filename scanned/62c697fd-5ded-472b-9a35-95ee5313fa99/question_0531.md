# Q0531: slippage bps unbounded in coinbase.ts

## Question
generateDepositAddress passes slippage_bps straight through when provided; can an attacker set an extreme slippage through the on-ramp URL handed to the user's browser so the executed swap returns far less than the quote implied?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/coinbase.ts](src/funding/coinbase.ts) - getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId, sessionToken, presetCryptoAmount, defaultNetwork, defaultAsset, partnerUserId), toCoinbaseBlockchainFromChainId, toCoinbaseAssetId, ASSET_ID_MAP, formatAmount('.'-prefix fix)
- Entrypoint: the on-ramp URL handed to the user's browser
- Attacker controls: amount string, chainId, asset, experience, and the session token/partner id echoed into the URL
- Exploit idea: Submit a very large slippage value and inspect the quote body.
- Invariant to test: Slippage must be bounded and surfaced before the quote is created.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit an out-of-range slippage to getCoinbaseOnRampUrl (pay.coinbase.com/buy/select-asset with appId and assert clamping or rejection.
