# Q0372: postMessage target origin is wildcard in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke posts with a '*' target origin; can an attacker whose frame receives that message read the access token, entropyId and signing payload carried in it through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Register a frame that receives the posted message and inspect the JSON payload.
- Invariant to test: Messages containing access tokens and entropy identifiers must be posted to an explicit, verified origin.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: spy on the message poster during EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert the target origin is not '*'.
