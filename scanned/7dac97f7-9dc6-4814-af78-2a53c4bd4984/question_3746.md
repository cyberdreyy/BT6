# Q3746: prepared state kept on the API instance in PasskeyApi.ts

## Question
src/client/auth/PasskeyApi.ts caches prepared state (wallet, prepared message) on the API object; can an attacker exploit a second init overwriting that state so a signature prepared for one address is submitted for another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/PasskeyApi.ts](src/client/auth/PasskeyApi.ts) - PasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions, loginWithPasskey, signupWithPasskey, linkWithPasskey, _transformAuthenticationResponseToSnakeCase
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.passkey.loginWithPasskey(response, challenge, relyingParty)
- Attacker controls: relyingParty string, challenge, authenticator response object fields
- Exploit idea: Call init for address A, then init for address B, then complete the login with A's signature.
- Invariant to test: Prepared authentication state must be bound to the address it was created for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two init calls and assert the login rejects a signature that does not match the latest prepared address.
