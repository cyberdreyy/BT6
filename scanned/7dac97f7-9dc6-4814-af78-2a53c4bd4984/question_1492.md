# Q1492: typed data domain unchecked against the chain in smart-wallets.ts

## Question
The domain (chainId, verifyingContract) is forwarded verbatim; can an attacker sign typed data whose domain chainId differs from the provider chain via smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY, producing a signature valid on another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/smart-wallets.ts](src/smart-wallets.ts) - smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY, COINBASE_SMART_WALLET, KERNEL, LIGHT_ACCOUNT, SAFE, THIRDWEB, NEXUS)
- Entrypoint: import {...} from '@privy-io/js-sdk-core/smart-wallets'
- Attacker controls: smart wallet type/version strings used for linking and routing
- Exploit idea: Submit typed data with a foreign domain.chainId while the provider is on mainnet.
- Invariant to test: The typed-data domain must agree with the provider's active chain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a mismatched domain chainId to smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY and assert rejection.
