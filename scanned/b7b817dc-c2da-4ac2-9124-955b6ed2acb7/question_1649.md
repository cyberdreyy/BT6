# Q1649: retry amplification per request in callback.SendResponse

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests make one accepted request at the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user cause repeated node work through the retry logic near `SendResponse`, multiplying DON execution per unit of entitlement?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go) -> `SendResponse`
- Entrypoint: the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user
- Attacker controls: timing of late responses (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `timing of late responses` that never reaches a terminal state.
- Invariant to test: retries must be bounded per request and counted against the caller's quota
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test counting node messages produced by one user request
