# Q1452: LocalStorage.get throws on non-JSON in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
LocalStorage.get calls JSON.parse without guarding; can an attacker place a non-JSON value under a privy: key so every subsequent PrivyInternal.fetch read throws and the SDK falls back to a less-safe path?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Write a raw string under a privy: key from the same origin and observe the read path.
- Invariant to test: A malformed stored value must degrade safely without changing authentication behaviour.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: set a non-JSON value and assert PrivyInternal.fetch treats it as absent rather than throwing into a fallback.
