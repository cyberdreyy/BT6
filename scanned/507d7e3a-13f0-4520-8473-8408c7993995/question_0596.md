# Q0596: error branch forges a wallet error in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages routes any reply with an error field into reject(new PrivyIframeError(type, message)); can an attacker deliver an error reply with type 'wallet_not_on_device' so toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction starts a recovery flow?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Post an error reply with the recovery-triggering type for a pending connect.
- Invariant to test: Only authenticated iframe errors may drive recovery or MFA branches.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: deliver a forged error reply through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert no recovery is attempted.
