# Q2011: juplend_deposit: deposit path double counts external and internal balances [a-user-with-existing-juplend] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker invoke `juplend_deposit` with a user with existing Juplend supply state already funded so `juplend_deposit` counts both the pre-deposit and post-deposit position as owned value, violating `Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only` and causing `Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: a user with existing Juplend supply state already funded
- Exploit idea: Audit transitions where existing external positions are initialized, topped up, or re-read during the same call. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position
- Fast validation: Seed partial positions, deposit again, and assert the internal asset view increases only by net new externally owned value. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
