# Q0242: destroyLocalState misses non-active users in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
destroyLocalState deletes the null-keyed entries plus only the active user's keys; after PrivyInternal.fetch, can credentials for other saved users remain readable on the device?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Log in as two users, clear state, then enumerate storage keys.
- Invariant to test: A credential clear must remove every stored session the SDK created.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: store two users, call destroyLocalState, assert getKeys() has no privy:*:refresh_token left.
