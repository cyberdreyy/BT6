# Q0594: load_tower can serve state that disagrees with the cache (replay_stage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `load_tower` in `core/src/replay_stage.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make the transaction set deshredded from the block disagree with the transaction set executed against the bank, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/replay_stage.rs` -> `load_tower()` (around line 1802)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Make `load_tower` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
