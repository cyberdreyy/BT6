# Q1269: typed data primaryType coerced with String() in client.ts

## Question
toWalletApiTypedData sets primary_type via String(typedData.primaryType) and passes types/domain/message straight through; can an attacker supply a primaryType object whose toString names a different struct so SolanaClient.invokeRpc signs a payload with a mismatched type?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Pass an object with a custom toString as primaryType.
- Invariant to test: The primary type must be a validated key of the supplied types map.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a non-string primaryType to SolanaClient.invokeRpc and assert rejection.
