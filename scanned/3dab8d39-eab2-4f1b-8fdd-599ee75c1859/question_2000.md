# Q2000: appId or clientId swapped at construction in LocalStorage.ts

## Question
Privy's constructor accepts appId, clientId, baseUrl, storage and crypto; can an attacker in the page reach LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse) with substituted options so requests are signed and stored under a different app namespace?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/LocalStorage.ts](src/storage/LocalStorage.ts) - LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse), put (JSON.stringify), del, getKeys
- Entrypoint: every Session/pkce/crossApp storage operation
- Attacker controls: any value another SDK surface can write under a privy: key on the same origin
- Exploit idea: Construct a second client with a different appId sharing the same storage and observe key collisions.
- Invariant to test: Storage namespacing must prevent one app id's session from being consumed by another.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two clients with different appIds over one Storage and assert no key collisions.
