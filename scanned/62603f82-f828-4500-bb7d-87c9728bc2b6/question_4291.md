# Q4291: method routing selects a weaker handler in bundler.setSignedResponse

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests name a method at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user that `setSignedResponse` routes to a handler with weaker authorization while the payload targets a privileged capability?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `setSignedResponse`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: the request that determines bundle composition (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `request that determines bundle composition` with a mismatched method/payload pair.
- Invariant to test: method routing and payload authorization must be consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: matrix test over method/payload mismatches
