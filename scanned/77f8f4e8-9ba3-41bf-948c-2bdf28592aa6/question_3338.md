# Q3338: analytics record recovery details in index.ts

## Question
setRecovery emits analytics containing address, target and existing recovery methods; can an attacker use throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath to learn another user's recovery configuration through those payloads?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/utils/index.ts](src/embedded/utils/index.ts) - throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath, getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.setRecovery({wallet, recoveryMethod, ...})
- Attacker controls: currentRecoveryMethod vs upgradeToRecoveryMethod pair, chain rpcUrls config
- Exploit idea: Trigger the events and inspect what leaves the device.
- Invariant to test: Recovery configuration must not be exported in analytics payloads.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture analytics during throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath and assert no recovery method or address is included.
