# Q5177: quorum/threshold check weak in bundler.newBundleSummary

## Question
Does the aggregation in `newBundleSummary` at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user accept a result below the configured threshold, count duplicates, or ignore mismatched payloads, so any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests's crafted request yields an unverified answer?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `newBundleSummary`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: the request that determines bundle composition (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Craft `request that determines bundle composition` that triggers the weak branch.
- Invariant to test: results must require distinct, verified contributions meeting the threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test over the aggregator with duplicate/insufficient inputs
