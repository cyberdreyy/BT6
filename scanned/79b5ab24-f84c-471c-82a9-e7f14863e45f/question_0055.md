# Q0055: chain silently switched by tx.chainId in getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProvider.ensureChainId calls internalSwitchEthereumChain with the chainId found in the request params; can an unprivileged attacker submit a transaction through every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call whose chainId silently repoints the provider and the RPC client to another chain before signing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts](src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts) - getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address
- Entrypoint: every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call
- Attacker controls: transaction structure, versioned vs legacy, address-table lookups, duplicate/ordered keys
- Exploit idea: Send eth_sendTransaction with a chainId the user never selected and observe chainChanged plus the new client.
- Invariant to test: The provider chain must only change through an explicit wallet_switchEthereumChain approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address with a foreign chainId and assert no silent switch and no signature.
