# Q0262: singleton queue shared across Privy clients in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
The callback queue is a module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; can an attacker in a multi-client or multi-user page make one client's reply settle another client's pending request via EventCallbackQueue.enqueue?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Instantiate two clients, start an operation on each, and deliver one reply.
- Invariant to test: Callback state must be scoped per client instance.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: create two proxies, enqueue on both through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert their callback maps are disjoint.
