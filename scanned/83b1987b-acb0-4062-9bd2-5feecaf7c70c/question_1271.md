# Q1271: typed data primaryType coerced with String() in unified-wallet.ts

## Question
toWalletApiTypedData sets primary_type via String(typedData.primaryType) and passes types/domain/message straight through; can an attacker supply a primaryType object whose toString names a different struct so isUnifiedWallet (account.id && recovery_method === 'privy-v2') signs a payload with a mismatched type?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/unified-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/unified-wallet.ts) - isUnifiedWallet (account.id && recovery_method === 'privy-v2')
- Entrypoint: branch selector between TEE wallet-api path and on-device iframe path
- Attacker controls: the linked-account object fields id and recovery_method
- Exploit idea: Pass an object with a custom toString as primaryType.
- Invariant to test: The primary type must be a validated key of the supplied types map.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a non-string primaryType to isUnifiedWallet (account.id && recovery_method === 'privy-v2') and assert rejection.
