# Q2184: root_slot_view is not deterministic across nodes (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `root_slot_view` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the commission applied when splitting rewards disagree with the commission stored in the vote account, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `root_slot_view` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `root_slot_view()` (around line 225)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `root_slot_view` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `root_slot_view` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `root_slot_view` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
