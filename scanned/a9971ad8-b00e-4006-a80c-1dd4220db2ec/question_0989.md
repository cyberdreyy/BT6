# Q0989: create-on-login policy evaluated client-side in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
validatePhoneNumber decides whether to provision a wallet from the createOnLogin setting and the user's existing accounts; can an attacker influence that evaluation so a wallet is created (or skipped) against the app's policy?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Present linked-account sets that flip each branch.
- Invariant to test: Provisioning policy must be evaluated against server-confirmed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: enumerate account sets through validatePhoneNumber and assert branch correctness.
