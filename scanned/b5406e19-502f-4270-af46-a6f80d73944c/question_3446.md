# Q3446: recovery of a wallet the user does not own in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
_load recovers based on the passed entropyId and verifier; can an attacker pass an entropyId for another user's wallet through RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and trigger a recovery attempt against it?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Call the provider path with a foreign entropyId.
- Invariant to test: Entropy identifiers must be verified against the authenticated user's linked accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign entropyId to RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert it is rejected.
