# Q3700: bucket::bucket_find_index_entry — index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction, reach `bucket::bucket_find_index_entry` and drive store/clean/shrink so the accounts index and storage disagree about an account's latest version, so that the invariant "the accounts index always points to the newest committed account version" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` -> `bucket_find_index_entry`
- Entrypoint: accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction
- Attacker controls: repeated writes and closes to accounts it owns
- Exploit idea: Drive store/clean/shrink so the accounts index and storage disagree about an account's latest version.
- Invariant to test: the accounts index always points to the newest committed account version.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write an accounts-db test storing/reloading the crafted account and asserting index==storage and no panic.
