# Q1319: instruction_data_len::process_instruction — lookup-table index confusion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `instruction_data_len::process_instruction` and use an address lookup table so the resolved writable/readonly account set differs from the sanitized privileges, so that the invariant "resolved ALT accounts carry exactly the privileges declared in the message" is violated, leading to Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/instruction_data_len.rs` -> `process_instruction`
- Entrypoint: a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the lookup table indexes and writable/readonly split in its v0 message
- Exploit idea: Use an address lookup table so the resolved writable/readonly account set differs from the sanitized privileges.
- Invariant to test: resolved ALT accounts carry exactly the privileges declared in the message.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds — Critical
- Fast validation: write a unit/fuzz test decoding the crafted message and assert sanitized privileges == enforced privileges.
