# Q2073: cpi_juplend_deposit: deposit accounting mints too much internal value [optional-accounts-that-affect-destination] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `juplend_deposit` with optional accounts that affect destination or market resolution so `cpi_juplend_deposit` credits more internal value than the external integration actually received, breaking `Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly` and causing `Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `cpi_juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: optional accounts that affect destination or market resolution
- Exploit idea: Audit share conversions, fee-adjusted transfers, and rounding around CPI deposit accounting. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Compare external protocol balances against marginfi internal balances after adversarial deposit amounts and assert no phantom value is minted. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
