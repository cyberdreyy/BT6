# Q2235: juplend_withdraw: withdraw intermediary flow can be replayed or interrupted [a-user-with-existing-juplend] [recipient-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker make `juplend_withdraw` drive `juplend_withdraw` with a user with existing Juplend position state already funded so an intermediary withdraw flow can be replayed, interrupted, or finalized twice, violating `Juplend withdraw must burn the right supply position and release only the value actually redeemed to the correct recipient` and causing `Critical: direct theft or phantom redemption`? Focus specifically on destination binding across intermediary ATAs, vault authorities, and final transfer-out.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/withdraw.rs` / `juplend_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a user with existing Juplend position state already funded
- Exploit idea: Audit multi-hop withdraws that pass through temporary ATAs or protocol-owned accounts before reaching the user. Focus specifically on destination binding across intermediary ATAs, vault authorities, and final transfer-out.
- Invariant to test: Juplend withdraw must burn the right supply position and release only the value actually redeemed to the correct recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or phantom redemption
- Fast validation: Replay or fail at each hop and assert no hop can be repeated or left value-bearing without a single canonical finalization. Swap every plausible destination and assert no accepted path releases value to an unvalidated recipient.
