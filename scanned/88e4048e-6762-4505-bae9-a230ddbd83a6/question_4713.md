# Q4713: length/format validation gap in bundler.newBundleSummary

## Question
Does the field validation in `newBundleSummary` at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user accept an over-long, truncated or non-hex identifier that later code slices or parses unchecked, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address a different workflow?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `newBundleSummary`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: repeat/duplicate requests (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `repeat/duplicate requests` at and beyond the documented length bounds.
- Invariant to test: every identifier must be length- and charset-validated before use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test at length boundaries for each identifier field
