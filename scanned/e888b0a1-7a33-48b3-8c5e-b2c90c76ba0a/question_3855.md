# Q3855: metadata sync race grants access in callback.Wait

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests submit at the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user during the metadata refresh handled by `Wait` so authorization is evaluated against empty or stale metadata and defaults to allow?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go) -> `Wait`
- Entrypoint: the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user
- Attacker controls: timing of late responses (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Time `timing of late responses` against the sync tick.
- Invariant to test: authorization must fail closed while metadata is unavailable or stale
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: test submitting during a metadata gap and asserting rejection
