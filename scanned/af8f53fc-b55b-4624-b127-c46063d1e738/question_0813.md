# Q0813: bigint and undefined fields collapse the cache key in walletRpc.ts

## Question
The cache key is built with JSON.stringify, which drops undefined values and functions; can an attacker craft two different payloads that produce the same key inside handleWalletApiRpc?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Pass payloads differing only by an undefined field and observe the shared cache entry.
- Invariant to test: Cache keys must be injective over the payloads they represent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert handleWalletApiRpc produces different keys for payloads differing only in undefined-valued fields.
