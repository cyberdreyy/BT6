# Q3892: ping doubles as a liveness oracle in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
ping() invokes privy:iframe:ready with a caller-controlled timeout; can an attacker use EventCallbackQueue.enqueue to keep the ready state true while the iframe is actually serving a different session?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Flip the iframe session and observe the cached ready flag.
- Invariant to test: Readiness must be invalidated when the underlying wallet session changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: change the session and assert EventCallbackQueue.enqueue re-verifies readiness.
