# Q1505: auth session results trusted as credentials in getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress.ts

## Question
loginWithCrossAppAuth reads privy_oauth_state and privy_oauth_code from the openAuthSession result and passes them to loginWithCode; can an attacker return crafted values through the auth session so getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress: first cross_app account whose embedded_wallets or smart_wallets contains the address performs an exchange with attacker-chosen material?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress.ts) - getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress: first cross_app account whose embedded_wallets or smart_wallets contains the address
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({address, ...})
- Attacker controls: the address argument and the set of cross_app accounts linked to the user
- Exploit idea: Return a hand-built auth session result.
- Invariant to test: Values returned by an external auth session must be validated against the flow's own PKCE state before use.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return crafted values into getCrossAppAccountByWalletAddress: first cross_app account whose embedded_wallets or smart_wallets contains the address and assert the stored state check rejects them.
