# Q3882: recovery access token reused across providers in MfaApi.ts

## Question
google-drive and icloud recovery both accept recoveryAccessToken; can an attacker present a token from one provider in the other's branch through MfaApi.verifyMfa?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts) - MfaApi.verifyMfa, initEnrollMfa, submitEnrollMfa, unenrollMfa, unlinkPasskey, clearMfa
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.unenrollMfa(method) / privy.mfa.clearMfa({userId})
- Attacker controls: method argument, credentialId, removeAsMfa, userId, call ordering against refreshSession
- Exploit idea: Call recovery with a mismatched provider/token pair.
- Invariant to test: Recovery tokens must be validated against the provider the wallet is bound to.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross provider and token in MfaApi.verifyMfa and assert rejection.
