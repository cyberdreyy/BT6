# Q1694: imported wallets bypass the fallback in walletCreate.ts

## Question
getEntropyDetailsFromUser returns the signing account directly when imported is set; can an attacker mark an account object as imported so createWalletApiWallet derives entropy from an account of their choosing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts) - createWalletApiWallet, create (privy-idempotency-key header)
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({idempotencyKey}) in user-controlled-server-wallets-only mode
- Attacker controls: idempotencyKey string, chainType, repeated concurrent creates
- Exploit idea: Pass a hand-built account with imported true.
- Invariant to test: Account flags used for entropy selection must come from server-confirmed data.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass {imported:true} on a crafted account to createWalletApiWallet and assert re-validation against the session user.
