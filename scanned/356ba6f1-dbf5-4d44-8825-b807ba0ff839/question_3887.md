# Q3887: recovery access token reused across providers in RecoveryICloudApi.ts

## Question
google-drive and icloud recovery both accept recoveryAccessToken; can an attacker present a token from one provider in the other's branch through RecoveryICloudApi.init?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryICloudApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryICloudApi.ts) - RecoveryICloudApi.init, getICloudConfiguration
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.icloudAuth.init(clientType)
- Attacker controls: client_type value, response fields used as recovery configuration
- Exploit idea: Call recovery with a mismatched provider/token pair.
- Invariant to test: Recovery tokens must be validated against the provider the wallet is bound to.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross provider and token in RecoveryICloudApi.init and assert rejection.
