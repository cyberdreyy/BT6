# Q3415: is_new_user drives privileged app UI in pkce.ts

## Question
generateState merges is_new_user and oauth_tokens from the authenticate response into the returned user; can an attacker influence those fields to make the integrating app treat an existing account as newly created?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Return is_new_user true for an existing account and observe the merged user object.
- Invariant to test: Merged response flags must be derived from the authenticated result, not accepted blindly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert generateState derives is_new_user from the server result for the same subject as the stored token.
