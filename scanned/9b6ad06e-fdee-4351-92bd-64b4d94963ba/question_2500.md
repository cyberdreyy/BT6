# Q2500: typed data mutated before sending in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
crossApp signTypedData passes the typed data through generateDomainType, which rewrites the EIP712Domain entry; can an attacker use crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] so the provider signs typed data whose type list differs from what the app displayed?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Submit typed data with an explicit EIP712Domain and compare before/after.
- Invariant to test: The bytes sent for signature must equal the bytes shown to the user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: diff input and outbound typed data in crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] and assert equality.
