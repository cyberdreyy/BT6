# Q2552: acceptTerms mutates without confirmation in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
UserApi.acceptTerms posts on behalf of the session with no argument; can an attacker trigger PrivyInternal.fetch from app code paths so terms are accepted without the user acting?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Call the method directly and observe the user object change.
- Invariant to test: State-changing user operations must require an explicit user action signal.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert PrivyInternal.fetch is not reachable from any automatic initialization path.
