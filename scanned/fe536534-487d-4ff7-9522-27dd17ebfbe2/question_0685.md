# Q685: loaded_programs::drain_modified_entries — loader budget mischarge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through the bpf_loader deploy/upgrade instruction from an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `loaded_programs::drain_modified_entries` and make program loading/JIT consume resources not charged to the deployer, or charged differently across nodes, so that the invariant "program load cost is deterministic and fully charged" is violated, leading to DoS / Consensus?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs` -> `drain_modified_entries`
- Entrypoint: the bpf_loader deploy/upgrade instruction from an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: program size and complexity it deploys
- Exploit idea: Make program loading/JIT consume resources not charged to the deployer, or charged differently across nodes.
- Invariant to test: program load cost is deterministic and fully charged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS / Consensus — High
- Fast validation: write a bank/program-test deploying the crafted ELF and assert verification/cache behaves identically across two runs.
