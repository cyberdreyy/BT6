# Q3936: wallet creation failure hidden in polling.ts

## Question
The refund path returns REFUND_WALLET_CREATION_FAILED from a bare catch; can an attacker force that failure in getDeposit and have the deposit created with a missing or stale refund address?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Fail the create route and inspect the resulting quote body.
- Invariant to test: A deposit must not be created without a valid refund address.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: fail the create route and assert getDeposit aborts the quote.
