# Q1833: address comparison is exact string equality in sendCrossAppRequest.ts

## Question
Address membership is tested by === without normalisation; can an attacker submit a checksummed or padded variant through sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type so the account is not found, or a different account is selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/sendCrossAppRequest.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/sendCrossAppRequest.ts) - sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type
- Entrypoint: any privy.crossApp.wallet.* call
- Attacker controls: the request payload, callbackUrl, and the privy_cross_app_type / privy_cross_app_payload pair returned to the SDK
- Exploit idea: Pass mixed-case and padded address variants.
- Invariant to test: Address comparison must be canonical.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test address forms through sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type.
