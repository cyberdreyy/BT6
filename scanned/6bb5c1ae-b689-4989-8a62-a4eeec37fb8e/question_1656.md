# Q1656: identity overwritten downstream in cookies.FindSessionCookie

## Question
Can a later middleware or handler on the path through `FindSessionCookie` overwrite the authenticated identity established at the Cookie header on any authenticated /v2 route using a request-controlled field?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/cookies.go](core/web/cookies.go) -> `FindSessionCookie`
- Entrypoint: the Cookie header on any authenticated /v2 route
- Attacker controls: multiple clsession cookies in one header (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Include `multiple clsession cookies in one header` whose name collides with the context key or session field used downstream.
- Invariant to test: the authenticated identity must be immutable after the auth middleware
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: handler test injecting colliding body/header fields and asserting the identity is unchanged
