# Q3870: events reveal credential lifecycle in LocalStorage.ts

## Question
Session emits token_stored, refresh_token_stored, oauth_tokens_granted with payloads; can an attacker attach a listener through app-reachable API and learn credential state changes or the tokens themselves?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/LocalStorage.ts](src/storage/LocalStorage.ts) - LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse), put (JSON.stringify), del, getKeys
- Entrypoint: every Session/pkce/crossApp storage operation
- Attacker controls: any value another SDK surface can write under a privy: key on the same origin
- Exploit idea: Register listeners and inspect the emitted payloads during LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse).
- Invariant to test: Session events from src/storage/LocalStorage.ts must not carry credential material.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture every event payload during LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse) and assert none contains a token string.
