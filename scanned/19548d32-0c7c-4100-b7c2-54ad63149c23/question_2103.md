# Q2103: nonce reuse across two logins in CustomProviderApi.ts

## Question
Can an attacker reuse a nonce previously issued by init()/fetchNonce for the same address to authenticate a second time from a different device or context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts](src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts) - CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken, linkWithToken
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.customProvider.syncWithToken(token, opts, mode)
- Attacker controls: the third-party JWT string, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Capture the nonce, complete a login, then replay message and signature.
- Invariant to test: Each issued nonce must be single-use for CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: complete a login and then replay the same message/signature and assert the second attempt fails.
