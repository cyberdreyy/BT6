# Q1099: external wallets suppress creation in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
validatePhoneNumber treats any linked external wallet of the chain as a reason to skip creation unless the mode is all-users; can an attacker link a wallet they control so the victim's embedded wallet is never created and the app falls back to the attacker's?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Link an external wallet then log in with users-without-wallets.
- Invariant to test: Provisioning decisions must not be steerable by linking an unrelated wallet.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: link an external wallet and assert validatePhoneNumber still provisions per policy.
