# Q2945: configure: public caller bypasses role-bound configuration [an-attacker-signer-with-a] [cross-object]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker invoke `marginfi_group_configure` with an attacker signer with a victim group and attacker-chosen new delegates so `configure` applies a group/bank configuration change without the intended role, violating `group-level delegate and admin updates must require the exact intended role and target the exact intended group only` and causing `Critical: privilege escalation to rewrite live protocol configuration`? Focus specifically on cross-group or cross-bank target confusion with a valid-looking signer/object pair.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_group/configure.rs` / `configure`
- Entrypoint: `marginfi_group_configure`
- Attacker controls: an attacker signer with a victim group and attacker-chosen new delegates
- Exploit idea: Attack every signer, delegate-role, and group/bank binding assumption on the path so configuration writes cannot be reached by a normal user. Focus specifically on cross-group or cross-bank target confusion with a valid-looking signer/object pair.
- Invariant to test: group-level delegate and admin updates must require the exact intended role and target the exact intended group only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: privilege escalation to rewrite live protocol configuration
- Fast validation: Use attacker-controlled signer/accounts against the config path and assert no protected field changes unless the exact authorized role signs. Create multiple target objects and assert valid authority for one can never mutate another through shape-compatible metadata.
