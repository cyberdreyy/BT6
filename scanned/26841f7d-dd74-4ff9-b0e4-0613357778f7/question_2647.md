# Q2647: shared_leader_state is not deterministic across nodes (poh_recorder.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `shared_leader_state` in `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the priority used to order a transaction disagree with the fee the transaction actually pays, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `shared_leader_state` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` -> `shared_leader_state()` (around line 756)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `shared_leader_state` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `shared_leader_state` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `shared_leader_state` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
