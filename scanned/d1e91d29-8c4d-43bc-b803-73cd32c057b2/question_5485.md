# Q5485: lib::get_precompile — zk-elgamal proof forgery

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a builtin-program instruction in a transaction from an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `lib::get_precompile` and submit a malformed zk-elgamal proof that the verifier accepts, or that verifies differently across validators, so that the invariant "proof verification is sound and deterministic" is violated, leading to Loss of Funds / Consensus?

## Target
- File/function: `precompiles/src/lib.rs` -> `get_precompile`
- Entrypoint: a builtin-program instruction in a transaction from an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the proof bytes and context data in a zk instruction
- Exploit idea: Submit a malformed zk-elgamal proof that the verifier accepts, or that verifies differently across validators.
- Invariant to test: proof verification is sound and deterministic.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds / Consensus — Critical
- Fast validation: write a program-test submitting the builtin/precompile instruction and assert the authorization/accounting invariant holds.
