# Q4412: rpc::clone_without_bigtable — single-request memory blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a single JSON-RPC/pubsub request from an unprivileged client, reach `rpc::clone_without_bigtable` and send one JSON-RPC request whose parameters make rpc.rs or parsed_token_accounts allocate unbounded memory, so that the invariant "a single request's memory use is bounded regardless of parameters" is violated, leading to RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/rpc.rs` -> `clone_without_bigtable`
- Entrypoint: a single JSON-RPC/pubsub request from an unprivileged client
- Attacker controls: the method parameters (ranges, encodings, filters) in one request
- Exploit idea: Send one JSON-RPC request whose parameters make rpc.rs or parsed_token_accounts allocate unbounded memory.
- Invariant to test: a single request's memory use is bounded regardless of parameters.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash — High
- Fast validation: write an rpc test issuing the single crafted request and asserting bounded memory/time and no panic.
