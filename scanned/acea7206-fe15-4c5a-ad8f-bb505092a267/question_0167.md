# Q0167: from address defaults to the wallet in offchain-message.ts

## Question
handlePopulateTransaction and handleEstimateGas use `transaction.from ?? this._account.address` while the signature is produced by the wallet regardless; can an attacker set a from that differs from the signer so the populated nonce and gas describe a different account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/offchain-message.ts](src/solana/offchain-message.ts) - deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes), buildSolanaOffchainMessage (255 + 'solana offchain' preamble, 1232 max), parseSolanaOffchainMessage
- Entrypoint: off-chain message construction for Solana signing
- Attacker controls: origin/domain string, message contents and length, raw bytes handed to the parser
- Exploit idea: Send a transaction with a foreign from and compare the populated fields to the signing account.
- Invariant to test: Populated fields must be derived from the account that will actually sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign from to deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes) and assert rejection or that population uses the signer address.
