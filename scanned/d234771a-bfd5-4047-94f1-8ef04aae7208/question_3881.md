# Q3881: recovery access token reused across providers in MfaPromises.ts

## Question
google-drive and icloud recovery both accept recoveryAccessToken; can an attacker present a token from one provider in the other's branch through MfaPromises.rootPromise?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/MfaPromises.ts](src/client/MfaPromises.ts) - MfaPromises.rootPromise, submitPromise, 'mfaRequired' event
- Entrypoint: privy.mfaPromises listeners in the integrating app
- Attacker controls: who resolves/rejects the shared promise refs, ordering of concurrent operations
- Exploit idea: Call recovery with a mismatched provider/token pair.
- Invariant to test: Recovery tokens must be validated against the provider the wallet is bound to.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross provider and token in MfaPromises.rootPromise and assert rejection.
