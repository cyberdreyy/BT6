# Q3473: secret identifier traversal in bundler.setSignedResponse

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address another namespace or owner through identifier separators/encoding in the request validated by `setSignedResponse` at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `setSignedResponse`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: fields echoed back into the bundle (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `fields echoed back into the bundle` with separators, encoded delimiters or empty components.
- Invariant to test: identifier components must be validated and joined unambiguously
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test over identifier parsing with hostile components
