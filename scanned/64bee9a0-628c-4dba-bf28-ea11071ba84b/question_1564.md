# Q1564: transaction_processor::replenish_program_cache — fee-distribution misallocation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `transaction_processor::replenish_program_cache` and craft transactions so collected fees/rent are distributed to the wrong account or double-credited, so that the invariant "collected fees and rent are distributed exactly once to the correct recipients" is violated, leading to Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` -> `replenish_program_cache`
- Entrypoint: a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the fee-payer set and burn/collector split it triggers
- Exploit idea: Craft transactions so collected fees/rent are distributed to the wrong account or double-credited.
- Invariant to test: collected fees and rent are distributed exactly once to the correct recipients.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds — Critical
- Fast validation: write an SVM/bank test running the transaction twice and asserting deterministic, exact fee/rollback/rent accounting.
