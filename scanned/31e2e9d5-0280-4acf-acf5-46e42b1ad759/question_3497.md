# Q3497: deposit config fetched but not enforced in poll.ts

## Question
getConfig returns currencies and chains but the generate path does not consult it; can an attacker submit a quote through poll: swallows operation errors for a pair the config excludes?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/poll.ts](src/utils/poll.ts) - poll: swallows operation errors, returns {status:'max_attempts'|'aborted'|'success'}
- Entrypoint: every deposit polling flow
- Attacker controls: operation results and errors, abort timing, attempt arithmetic
- Exploit idea: Submit an excluded pair after fetching the config.
- Invariant to test: The client must enforce the fetched configuration before creating a quote.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit an excluded pair to poll: swallows operation errors and assert refusal.
