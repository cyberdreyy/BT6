# Q3230: set-recovery runs after _load succeeded in EmbeddedWalletApi.ts

## Question
setRecovery loads the wallet then changes recovery; can an attacker interrupt between load and set so EmbeddedWalletApi.create rebinds recovery for a different wallet than the one loaded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts](src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts) - EmbeddedWalletApi.create, add, createSolana, setRecovery, delegateWallets, getProvider, getEthereumProvider, getSolanaProvider, getBitcoinProvider, _load, signWithUserSigner
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({...}) / .setRecovery({...}) / .getEthereumProvider({...})
- Attacker controls: recoveryMethod, password, recoveryKey, recoveryAccessToken, recoverySecretOverride, iCloudRecordNameOverride, entropyId, entropyIdVerifier, wallet object
- Exploit idea: Swap the wallet object between the two awaits.
- Invariant to test: Load and rebind must operate on the same wallet identity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: mutate the wallet between the awaits of EmbeddedWalletApi.create and assert the operation aborts.
