# Q1097: request id mismatch tolerated in shard_endpoints.buildShardEndpoints

## Question
Does `buildShardEndpoints` at shard selection for a user trigger request routed to a sharded DON tolerate a mismatch between the id inside a signed payload and the id of the request being answered, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests splice a response from another request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/shard_endpoints.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/shard_endpoints.go) -> `buildShardEndpoints`
- Entrypoint: shard selection for a user trigger request routed to a sharded DON
- Attacker controls: donId/shard fields in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `donId/shard fields in the request` whose ids differ.
- Invariant to test: the signed id must equal the served request id
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test asserting mismatched ids are rejected
