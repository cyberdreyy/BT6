# Q0884: update flow accepts mismatched old/new identifiers in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
In src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts, can an attacker submit an update request whose old identifier is not the one currently linked, so the code they hold is applied against a different identifier binding?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Call the update method with an arbitrary old value plus a valid code for another identifier and observe client-side acceptance.
- Invariant to test: OAuthApi.generateURL must bind the verification code to the exact identifier pair currently on the account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call the update method with mismatched old identifier and assert the SDK does not issue the request.
