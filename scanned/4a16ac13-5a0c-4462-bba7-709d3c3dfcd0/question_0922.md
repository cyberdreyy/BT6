# Q0922: reload flush rejects unrelated operations in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
reload() flushes the shared queue and rejects every pending callback; can an attacker trigger a reload through app-reachable API so a victim's in-flight signing operation is cancelled and retried under attacker-chosen conditions?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Start a signature, call the reload path and observe the rejection and the app's retry.
- Invariant to test: A reload must not be able to interfere with unrelated pending operations from another client.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start a signature, call reload via EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert the operation fails closed with no retry.
