# Q2102: cpi_juplend_deposit: deposit intermediary transfer and CPI accounting diverge [tiny-deposit-amounts-stressing-share] [net-value]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `cpi_juplend_deposit` through `juplend_deposit` with tiny deposit amounts stressing share conversion branches so intermediary token transfer and CPI deposit accounting diverge, breaking `Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly` and causing `Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `cpi_juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: tiny deposit amounts stressing share conversion branches
- Exploit idea: Look for separate phases where user funds move to an intermediary owner/vault before the external CPI settles. Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.
- Invariant to test: Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Force controlled transfer/account edges and assert internal credits only appear if the external CPI consumed the matching amount. Compare user debit, external protocol credit, and internal asset increase and assert all three line up exactly.
