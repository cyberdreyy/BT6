# Q0057: chain silently switched by tx.chainId in offchain-message.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProvider.ensureChainId calls internalSwitchEthereumChain with the chainId found in the request params; can an unprivileged attacker submit a transaction through off-chain message construction for Solana signing whose chainId silently repoints the provider and the RPC client to another chain before signing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/offchain-message.ts](src/solana/offchain-message.ts) - deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes), buildSolanaOffchainMessage (255 + 'solana offchain' preamble, 1232 max), parseSolanaOffchainMessage
- Entrypoint: off-chain message construction for Solana signing
- Attacker controls: origin/domain string, message contents and length, raw bytes handed to the parser
- Exploit idea: Send eth_sendTransaction with a chainId the user never selected and observe chainChanged plus the new client.
- Invariant to test: The provider chain must only change through an explicit wallet_switchEthereumChain approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call deriveSolanaApplicationDomain (utf8 truncate/pad to 32 bytes) with a foreign chainId and assert no silent switch and no signature.
