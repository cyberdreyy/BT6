# Q3714: bucket::try_write — append-vec corruption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction, reach `bucket::try_write` and store an account whose append-vec/accounts-file encoding produces an out-of-bounds read or corrupt entry on reload, so that the invariant "every stored account round-trips to identical bytes and bounds" is violated, leading to Consensus / Liveness (DoS)?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` -> `try_write`
- Entrypoint: accounts created/mutated by an unprivileged fee-payer transaction
- Attacker controls: the data length and layout of an account it creates
- Exploit idea: Store an account whose append-vec/accounts-file encoding produces an out-of-bounds read or corrupt entry on reload.
- Invariant to test: every stored account round-trips to identical bytes and bounds.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus / Liveness (DoS) — Critical
- Fast validation: write an accounts-db test storing/reloading the crafted account and asserting index==storage and no panic.
