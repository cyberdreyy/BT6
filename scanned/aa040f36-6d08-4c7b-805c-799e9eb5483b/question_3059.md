# Q3059: solana usdc mint empty for testnet in MoonpayOnRampApi.ts

## Question
SolanaUsdcAddressMap has an empty string for testnet while getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster throws for it; can an attacker reach the map-based path through MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign) so an empty mint address is used as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/funding/MoonpayOnRampApi.ts](src/client/funding/MoonpayOnRampApi.ts) - MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign), getTransactionStatus (direct api.moonpay.com fetch with embedded pk_live key)
- Entrypoint: privy.funding.moonpay.sign(input) / getTransactionStatus({transactionId, useSandbox})
- Attacker controls: the sign input body (walletAddress, currency, amount) and transactionId
- Exploit idea: Select testnet and follow both code paths.
- Invariant to test: Missing mint data must fail closed on every path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: select testnet through MoonpayOnRampApi.sign (MoonpayOnRampSign) and assert both paths error.
