# Q0241: role string comparison weakness in gql.AuthenticateGQL

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role obtain a role value that passes the comparison performed on the path through `AuthenticateGQL` (case, whitespace or prefix handling) even though the stored role is lower-privileged?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/gql.go](core/web/auth/gql.go) -> `AuthenticateGQL`
- Entrypoint: POST /query (GraphQL) guarded by AuthenticateGQL
- Attacker controls: batched operations in one request (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `batched operations in one request` so the role string persisted or parsed differs in case/whitespace from the constant compared at the gate.
- Invariant to test: role comparison must be exact-match over the canonical role enum
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test feeding role variants ('Admin', ' admin', 'admin\n') through the role check
