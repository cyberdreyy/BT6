# Q1466: passkey mfa options echo caller fields in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions forwards the caller's input; can an attacker set relying-party or allowed-credential fields so the MFA ceremony accepts a credential they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Call RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL with crafted options and inspect the ceremony parameters returned.
- Invariant to test: MFA ceremony parameters must be derived server-side from the enrolled credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass crafted options to RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert they are not forwarded.
