# Q1941: smart-wallet method chosen by address membership in loginWithCrossAppAuth.ts

## Question
isCrossAppWalletSmart decides between personal_sign and privy_signSmartWalletMessage purely by address membership in smart_wallets; can an attacker cause the wrong method to be selected in loginWithCrossAppAuth: oauth.generateURL(`privy:${providerAppId}` so the signature has different semantics than the user approved?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/loginWithCrossAppAuth.ts](src/action/crossApp/loginWithCrossAppAuth.ts) - loginWithCrossAppAuth: oauth.generateURL(`privy:${providerAppId}`, redirectUrl) -> openAuthSession -> oauth.loginWithCode -> crossApp.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.loginWithCrossAppAuth({providerAppId, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: providerAppId string, redirectUrl, the privy_oauth_state / privy_oauth_code values returned by the auth session
- Exploit idea: Place the address in both lists and observe the chosen method.
- Invariant to test: Signing method selection must be explicit and verified against the wallet type.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct an ambiguous account and assert loginWithCrossAppAuth: oauth.generateURL(`privy:${providerAppId}` rejects rather than guessing.
