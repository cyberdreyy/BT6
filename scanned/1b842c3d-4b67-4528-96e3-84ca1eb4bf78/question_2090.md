# Q2090: undecodable responses counted as valid in webapi.Validate

## Question
Does `Validate` at the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint count undecodable or error responses toward success, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests force a result with fewer honest contributions?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go) -> `Validate`
- Entrypoint: the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint
- Attacker controls: rate/quota-relevant fields (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Trigger the mixed-response branch with `rate/quota-relevant fields`.
- Invariant to test: only successfully decoded, verified responses may count
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test with mixed decodable/undecodable responses
