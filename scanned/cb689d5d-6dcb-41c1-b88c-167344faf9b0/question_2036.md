# Q2036: path normalization mismatch in cookies.FindSessionCookie

## Question
Can an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port reach a protected handler through `FindSessionCookie` using a path variant (trailing slash, double slash, encoded segment) that the router matches but the role middleware does not?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/cookies.go](core/web/cookies.go) -> `FindSessionCookie`
- Entrypoint: the Cookie header on any authenticated /v2 route
- Attacker controls: cookie value encoding (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `cookie value encoding` in normalized and non-normalized forms.
- Invariant to test: route matching and middleware application must operate on the same normalized path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: route test comparing handler execution across path variants
