# Q2436: challenge not bound to the stored options in maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts

## Question
Does maybeCreateWalletOnLogin accept a challenge argument supplied by the caller rather than the one returned by the matching options call, enabling replay of a previously captured assertion?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts](src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts) - maybeCreateWalletOnLogin, shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet, shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet, mergeUser
- Entrypoint: every auth.*.login* path after token storage
- Attacker controls: opts.embedded.{ethereum,solana}.createOnLogin, pre-existing linked wallets
- Exploit idea: Call the options method, discard the challenge, and log in with an older challenge plus its captured assertion.
- Invariant to test: The challenge submitted must be the one issued for this ceremony.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a stale challenge to maybeCreateWalletOnLogin and assert it is rejected.
