# Q2576: wallet-api rpc method echo check only in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
walletRpc verifies the response method name equals the requested one but not the wallet or params; can an attacker return a signature produced for another payload through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Return a response whose method matches but whose signature is for a different message.
- Invariant to test: A signing response must be bound to the exact request that produced it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a mismatched signature from toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction's route and assert it is rejected.
