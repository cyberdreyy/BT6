# Q3304: group-to-role mapping too permissive in sessions_controller.Create

## Question
Does the group-to-role mapping performed by `Create` at POST /sessions and DELETE /sessions grant an elevated role on a partial, case-insensitive or substring match, letting an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port in a low-privilege group obtain admin?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/sessions_controller.go](core/web/sessions_controller.go) -> `Create`
- Entrypoint: POST /sessions and DELETE /sessions
- Attacker controls: email, password and WebAuthn fields (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Authenticate with `email, password and WebAuthn fields` from a group whose name embeds the privileged group name.
- Invariant to test: group mapping must be an exact match against the configured DN/claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test mapping crafted group names to roles
