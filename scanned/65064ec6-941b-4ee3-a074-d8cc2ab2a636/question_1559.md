# Q1559: per-owner quota not enforced in webapi.Validate

## Question
Does `Validate` at the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint enforce rate/quota per authenticated owner, or can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests rotate identifiers to obtain unlimited DON execution charged elsewhere?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go) -> `Validate`
- Entrypoint: the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint
- Attacker controls: workflow identifiers in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Rotate `workflow identifiers in the request` across submissions.
- Invariant to test: quotas must key on the verified owner and be enforced before dispatch
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test rotating identifiers and asserting the quota still applies
