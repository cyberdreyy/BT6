# Q2900: verifyMfa reachable without a pending operation in EmbeddedWalletApi.ts

## Question
MfaApi.verifyMfa can be invoked directly; can an attacker call EmbeddedWalletApi.create to consume an MFA code outside any operation, leaving a satisfied MFA state that a later operation reuses?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts](src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts) - EmbeddedWalletApi.create, add, createSolana, setRecovery, delegateWallets, getProvider, getEthereumProvider, getSolanaProvider, getBitcoinProvider, _load, signWithUserSigner
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({...}) / .setRecovery({...}) / .getEthereumProvider({...})
- Attacker controls: recoveryMethod, password, recoveryKey, recoveryAccessToken, recoverySecretOverride, iCloudRecordNameOverride, entropyId, entropyIdVerifier, wallet object
- Exploit idea: Call verifyMfa alone, then immediately start a signing operation.
- Invariant to test: An MFA verification must be consumed by the operation that required it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Integration test: call EmbeddedWalletApi.create then a signature and assert the signature still requires its own MFA round.
