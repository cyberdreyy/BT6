# Q2482: deserialize_parameters_for_abiv0 decodes attacker data into a wrong but plausible result (serialization.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `deserialize_parameters_for_abiv0` in `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and have `deserialize_parameters_for_abiv0` render the raw bytes as a different but plausible program, authority, amount, or decimals, so that the invariant "Parsed output faithfully represents the raw bytes, or the decoder reports 'unparsed'." breaks and the result is RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` -> `deserialize_parameters_for_abiv0()` (around line 429)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Author instruction/account bytes that `deserialize_parameters_for_abiv0` renders with the wrong program, authority, amount, or decimals, misleading downstream consumers.
- Invariant to test: Parsed output faithfully represents the raw bytes, or the decoder reports 'unparsed'.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash - single low-rate call from one client crashes or stalls the node (20-65 SOL)
- Fast validation: Round-trip test: parse then re-encode; assert equality, and assert ambiguous input is reported as unparsed.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
