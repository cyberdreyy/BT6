# Q3341: request id mismatch tolerated in workflow_metadata_handler.Authorize

## Question
Does `Authorize` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request tolerate a mismatch between the id inside a signed payload and the id of the request being answered, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests splice a response from another request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `Authorize`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request` whose ids differ.
- Invariant to test: the signed id must equal the served request id
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test asserting mismatched ids are rejected
