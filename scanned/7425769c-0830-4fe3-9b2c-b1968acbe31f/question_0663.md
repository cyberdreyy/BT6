# Q0663: returned user object is not re-read from session in PhoneApi.ts

## Question
Does PhoneApi.sendCode return the user object from the authenticate response (merged by mergeUser) without re-reading the freshly stored session, letting a stale or attacker-influenced response drive the app's is_new_user and linked_accounts view?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts](src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts) - PhoneApi.sendCode, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, updatePhone, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.loginWithCode(phone, code)
- Attacker controls: phoneNumber string (unnormalized), code, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Return an authenticate response whose user payload disagrees with the token subject and observe which value reaches the setUser callback.
- Invariant to test: The user object handed to setUser must be consistent with the subject of the token that was just stored.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the response user.id differ from the JWT sub in the same response and assert PhoneApi.sendCode rejects instead of calling setUser.
