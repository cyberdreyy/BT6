# Q1097: maybe_take_bank_mint: transfer-hook or mint capability probe can be bypassed by account substitution [candidate-mints-from-another-bank] [amount-domain]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy` with candidate mints from another bank with the same token program so `maybe_take_bank_mint` misprobes a mint capability because of account substitution, violating `mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts` and causing `High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss`? Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `maybe_take_bank_mint`
- Entrypoint: `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy`
- Attacker controls: candidate mints from another bank with the same token program
- Exploit idea: Even though admin listing choices are out of scope, a public bug in capability probing or enforcement remains in scope if it affects live banks. Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.
- Invariant to test: mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss
- Fast validation: Supply alternate mint/account combos around a live path and assert the utility reports capabilities only for the exact bank mint in use. Fuzz one-unit and boundary values and assert debited, credited, and accounted amounts all reconcile exactly.
