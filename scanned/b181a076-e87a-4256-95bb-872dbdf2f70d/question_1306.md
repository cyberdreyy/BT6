# Q1306: cpi_kamino_deposit: deposit accounting mints too much internal value [a-preexisting-external-position-whose] [net-value]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `kamino_deposit` with a preexisting external position whose owner metadata can be swapped so `cpi_kamino_deposit` credits more internal value than the external integration actually received, breaking `external CPI deposit and internal marginfi accounting must be economically atomic and identically sized` and causing `Critical: phantom value, protocol loss, or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/kamino/deposit.rs` / `cpi_kamino_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `kamino_deposit`
- Attacker controls: a preexisting external position whose owner metadata can be swapped
- Exploit idea: Audit share conversions, fee-adjusted transfers, and rounding around CPI deposit accounting. Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.
- Invariant to test: external CPI deposit and internal marginfi accounting must be economically atomic and identically sized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value, protocol loss, or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Compare external protocol balances against marginfi internal balances after adversarial deposit amounts and assert no phantom value is minted. Compare user debit, external protocol credit, and internal asset increase and assert all three line up exactly.
