# Q2332: storage accessibility probe leaks a key in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
isStorageAccessible writes privy:__storage__test-<uuid> before every refresh; can an attacker use the residue or the failure path of PrivyInternal.fetch to influence whether refresh proceeds?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Make the probe fail transiently and observe the refresh being skipped while credentials remain.
- Invariant to test: A storage probe failure must not silently change session lifecycle decisions.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make put throw once and assert PrivyInternal.fetch surfaces the error rather than continuing with stale state.
