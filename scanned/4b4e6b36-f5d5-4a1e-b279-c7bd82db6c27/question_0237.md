# Q0237: destroyLocalState misses non-active users in Session.ts

## Question
destroyLocalState deletes the null-keyed entries plus only the active user's keys; after Session.updateWithTokensResponse, can credentials for other saved users remain readable on the device?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Session.ts](src/Session.ts) - Session.updateWithTokensResponse, destroyLocalState, switchActiveUserId, backfillLegacySession, getOrCreateGuestCredential, tokenIsActive
- Entrypoint: any login/refresh/logout path
- Attacker controls: stored values under privy:token / privy:pat / privy:refresh_token / privy:id-token / privy:active-user / privy:saved-users, cookie twins
- Exploit idea: Log in as two users, clear state, then enumerate storage keys.
- Invariant to test: A credential clear must remove every stored session the SDK created.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: store two users, call destroyLocalState, assert getKeys() has no privy:*:refresh_token left.
