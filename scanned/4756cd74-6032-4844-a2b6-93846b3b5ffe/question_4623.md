# Q4623: rpc::start_with_config — filter compile DoS

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a single JSON-RPC/pubsub request from an unprivileged client, reach `rpc::start_with_config` and supply a getProgramAccounts-style filter that filter.rs compiles into a pathological match, within default limits, so that the invariant "filter evaluation cost per request is bounded" is violated, leading to RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/rpc.rs` -> `start_with_config`
- Entrypoint: a single JSON-RPC/pubsub request from an unprivileged client
- Attacker controls: the memcmp/dataSize filter set in one request
- Exploit idea: Supply a getProgramAccounts-style filter that filter.rs compiles into a pathological match, within default limits.
- Invariant to test: filter evaluation cost per request is bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash — High
- Fast validation: write an rpc test issuing the single crafted request and asserting bounded memory/time and no panic.
