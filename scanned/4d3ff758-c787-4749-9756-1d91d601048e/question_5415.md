# Q5415: metrics token comparison in api.nextLink

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role authenticate to the metrics endpoint gated near `nextLink` by exploiting a weak or non-constant-time token comparison, obtaining node internals used to plan key theft?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/api.go](core/web/api.go) -> `nextLink`
- Entrypoint: page/size query parameters on /v2 index endpoints
- Attacker controls: JSON:API document fields in the request body (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Probe `JSON:API document fields in the request body` with prefix-varied tokens.
- Invariant to test: metrics auth must use constant-time comparison of the full token
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: unit test on the metrics auth helper with near-miss tokens
