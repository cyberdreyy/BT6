# Q1948: smart-wallet method chosen by address membership in signMessage.ts

## Question
isCrossAppWalletSmart decides between personal_sign and privy_signSmartWalletMessage purely by address membership in smart_wallets; can an attacker cause the wrong method to be selected in crossApp signMessage: params [message so the signature has different semantics than the user approved?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts) - crossApp signMessage: params [message, address], method chosen by isCrossAppWalletSmart
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({user, address, message, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: message bytes/string, address, redirectUrl, provider response payload
- Exploit idea: Place the address in both lists and observe the chosen method.
- Invariant to test: Signing method selection must be explicit and verified against the wallet type.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct an ambiguous account and assert crossApp signMessage: params [message rejects rather than guessing.
