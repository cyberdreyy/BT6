# Q2562: recovery timeout window is 120 seconds in MfaApi.ts

## Question
The user-owned recovery path resolves on a 120000ms timer with onRecovered; can an attacker call onRecovered without completing recovery so MfaApi.verifyMfa proceeds as if the wallet were restored?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts) - MfaApi.verifyMfa, initEnrollMfa, submitEnrollMfa, unenrollMfa, unlinkPasskey, clearMfa
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.unenrollMfa(method) / privy.mfa.clearMfa({userId})
- Attacker controls: method argument, credentialId, removeAsMfa, userId, call ordering against refreshSession
- Exploit idea: Invoke the onRecovered callback from app-reachable code and observe the operation continuing.
- Invariant to test: Recovery completion must be proven by the iframe, not by a callback invocation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: invoke onRecovered without a real recovery and assert MfaApi.verifyMfa still fails.
