# Q0398: canonicalize drops undefined fields in update-wallet.ts

## Question
generateAuthorizationSignature canonicalises the payload with canonicalize(), which omits undefined values and cannot represent them; can an attacker craft two semantically different payloads that canonicalise identically and reuse one signature for the other through updateWallet(): signs {version:1?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts) - updateWallet(): signs {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id}, body} with NO privy-request-expiry header
- Entrypoint: session signer add/remove
- Attacker controls: the body (additional_signers) and the resulting long-lived authorization signature
- Exploit idea: Build payloads differing only by undefined-valued or key-ordered fields and compare the canonical strings.
- Invariant to test: Canonicalisation must be injective over the payloads it authorises.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert updateWallet(): signs {version:1 produces distinct signatures for semantically distinct payloads.
