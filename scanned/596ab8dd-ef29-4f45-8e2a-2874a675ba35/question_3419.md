# Q3419: is_new_user drives privileged app UI in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
createSiwsMessage({address merges is_new_user and oauth_tokens from the authenticate response into the returned user; can an attacker influence those fields to make the integrating app treat an existing account as newly created?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Return is_new_user true for an existing account and observe the merged user object.
- Invariant to test: Merged response flags must be derived from the authenticated result, not accepted blindly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert createSiwsMessage({address derives is_new_user from the server result for the same subject as the stored token.
