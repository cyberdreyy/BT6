# Q0395: canonicalize drops undefined fields in raw-sign.ts

## Question
generateAuthorizationSignature canonicalises the payload with canonicalize(), which omits undefined values and cannot represent them; can an attacker craft two semantically different payloads that canonicalise identically and reuse one signature for the other through rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts](src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts) - rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign
- Entrypoint: raw-hash signing on an extended-chains wallet
- Attacker controls: the hash/params body fields and wallet_id
- Exploit idea: Build payloads differing only by undefined-valued or key-ordered fields and compare the canonical strings.
- Invariant to test: Canonicalisation must be injective over the payloads it authorises.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign produces distinct signatures for semantically distinct payloads.
