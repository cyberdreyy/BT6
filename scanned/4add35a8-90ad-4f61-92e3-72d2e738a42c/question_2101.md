# Q2101: nonce reuse across two logins in FarcasterV2Api.ts

## Question
Can an attacker reuse a nonce previously issued by init()/fetchNonce for the same address to authenticate a second time from a different device or context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterV2Api.ts) - FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth, authenticate
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcasterV2.authenticate({message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: SIWF message, signature, fid
- Exploit idea: Capture the nonce, complete a login, then replay message and signature.
- Invariant to test: Each issued nonce must be single-use for FarcasterV2Api.initializeAuth.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: complete a login and then replay the same message/signature and assert the second attempt fails.
