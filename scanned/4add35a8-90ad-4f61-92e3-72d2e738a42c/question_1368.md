# Q1368: entropyIdVerifier argument ignored in entropy.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletApi.getEthereumProvider forwards the caller's entropyId but constructs the provider with a hardcoded 'ethereum-address-verifier'; can an attacker exploit that mismatch through getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana) so connect and rpc use inconsistent entropy identities?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/entropy.ts](src/utils/entropy.ts) - getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana), getEntropyDetailsFromAccount (address as entropyId + <chain>-address-verifier)
- Entrypoint: provider construction for any embedded wallet
- Attacker controls: which linked account is passed as signingAccount, wallet_index ordering, imported flag
- Exploit idea: Pass a solana verifier with an ethereum wallet and compare the connect and rpc payloads.
- Invariant to test: The entropy identity used to connect must be the identity used to sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call getEntropyDetailsFromUser (imported ? account : first eth ?? first solana) with a non-default verifier and assert the same verifier reaches every proxy call.
