# Q0284: wallet_id lives only in the URL in rpc.ts

## Question
The signed envelope includes the compiled url but the body omits wallet_id; can an attacker exploit URL/body separation in rpc(): builds {version:1 so a signature produced for one wallet path is presented for another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Compare envelopes for two wallet ids and test whether the server-visible binding is only positional.
- Invariant to test: Wallet identity must be bound inside the signed body as well as the path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert rpc(): builds {version:1 includes wallet_id in the signed payload.
