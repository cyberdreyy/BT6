# Q1397: validation happens after dispatch in codec.Codec

## Question
Does `Codec` at the encode/decode boundary for gateway user requests and responses dispatch the request to the DON before validation completes, so any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests's invalid request still consumes DON work or reaches capability code?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/api/codec.go](core/services/gateway/api/codec.go) -> `Codec`
- Entrypoint: the encode/decode boundary for gateway user requests and responses
- Attacker controls: encoding variants of the same logical request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Send `encoding variants of the same logical request` that fails late in validation.
- Invariant to test: no dispatch may precede complete validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test asserting no node message is sent for invalid requests
