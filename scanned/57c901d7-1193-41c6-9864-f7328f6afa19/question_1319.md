# Q1319: selection result cached by the app in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
Values from validatePhoneNumber are commonly cached by integrating apps; can an attacker change the user's accounts so a cached selection points at a wallet that no longer belongs to the session?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Change accounts after a selection and continue signing.
- Invariant to test: Selections must be invalidated when the user object changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: mutate accounts after validatePhoneNumber and assert the stale selection is refused.
