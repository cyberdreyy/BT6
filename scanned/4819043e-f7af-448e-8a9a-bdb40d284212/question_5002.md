# Q5002: expiry check allows stale entries in http_trigger_handler.validatedTriggerRequest

## Question
Does the expiry logic in `validatedTriggerRequest` at HandleUserTriggerRequest on the public gateway endpoint (workflow HTTP trigger) keep serving a stale entry (inverted comparison, missing zero-value handling), letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests pin an outdated result?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_trigger_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_trigger_handler.go) -> `validatedTriggerRequest`
- Entrypoint: HandleUserTriggerRequest on the public gateway endpoint (workflow HTTP trigger)
- Attacker controls: workflowID, workflowOwner, workflowName, workflowTag fields (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `workflowID, workflowOwner, workflowName, workflowTag fields` around the expiry boundary.
- Invariant to test: expired entries must never be served
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: table test at expiry boundaries
