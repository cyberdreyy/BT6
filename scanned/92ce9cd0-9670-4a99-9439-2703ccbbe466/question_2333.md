# Q2333: storage accessibility probe leaks a key in Privy.ts

## Question
isStorageAccessible writes privy:__storage__test-<uuid> before every refresh; can an attacker use the residue or the failure path of Privy constructor to influence whether refresh proceeds?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Make the probe fail transiently and observe the refresh being skipped while credentials remain.
- Invariant to test: A storage probe failure must not silently change session lifecycle decisions.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make put throw once and assert Privy constructor surfaces the error rather than continuing with stale state.
