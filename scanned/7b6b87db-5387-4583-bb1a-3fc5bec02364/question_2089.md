# Q2089: undecodable responses counted as valid in handler.UserCallbackPayload

## Question
Does `UserCallbackPayload` at the gateway handler interface boundary every public user request passes through count undecodable or error responses toward success, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests force a result with fewer honest contributions?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/handler.go) -> `UserCallbackPayload`
- Entrypoint: the gateway handler interface boundary every public user request passes through
- Attacker controls: request repetition (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Trigger the mixed-response branch with `request repetition`.
- Invariant to test: only successfully decoded, verified responses may count
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test with mixed decodable/undecodable responses
