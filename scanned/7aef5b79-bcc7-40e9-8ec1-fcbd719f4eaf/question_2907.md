# Q2907: hex detection via loose regex in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
The hex predicate accepts any 0x-prefixed hex string of any length, including empty; can an attacker exploit that in toWalletApiTypedData (types so a zero-length or odd-length value is passed to the signer?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Submit '0x' and an odd-length hex string.
- Invariant to test: Hex inputs must be length-validated before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: feed '0x' and odd-length values to toWalletApiTypedData (types and assert rejection.
