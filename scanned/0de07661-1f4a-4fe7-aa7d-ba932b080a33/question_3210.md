# Q3210: key builder collides on crafted user ids in LocalStorage.ts

## Question
Token storage keys are built by string interpolation of the user id; can an attacker obtain or seed a user id containing ':' so keys for two users collide?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/LocalStorage.ts](src/storage/LocalStorage.ts) - LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse), put (JSON.stringify), del, getKeys
- Entrypoint: every Session/pkce/crossApp storage operation
- Attacker controls: any value another SDK surface can write under a privy: key on the same origin
- Exploit idea: Store sessions for ids 'a' and 'a:token' style values and compare resulting keys.
- Invariant to test: Key construction in src/storage/LocalStorage.ts must be injective over user ids.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse) produces distinct keys for ids that differ only by separators.
