# Q3548: flush can serve state that disagrees with the cache (banking_trace.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `flush` in `core/src/banking_trace.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make the replay result on a fresh node disagree with the replay result on a node warm from cache, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_trace.rs` -> `flush()` (around line 171)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Make `flush` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
