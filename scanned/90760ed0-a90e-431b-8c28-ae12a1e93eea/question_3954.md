# Q3954: error text discloses key or file paths in loop_registry.discoveryHandler

## Question
Do errors from `discoveryHandler` at the LOOP plugin registry HTTP routes (discovery, per-plugin metrics and pprof handlers) reveal keystore paths, key ids, addresses or DB structure that let an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role target the next step of a key-theft chain?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/loop_registry.go](core/web/loop_registry.go) -> `discoveryHandler`
- Entrypoint: the LOOP plugin registry HTTP routes (discovery, per-plugin metrics and pprof handlers)
- Attacker controls: arbitrary sub-paths under the plugin route (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Force errors with `arbitrary sub-paths under the plugin route`.
- Invariant to test: errors must not disclose key identities or filesystem layout
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: handler test asserting error bodies exclude paths and key ids
