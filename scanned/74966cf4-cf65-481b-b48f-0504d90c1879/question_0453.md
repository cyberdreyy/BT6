# Q0453: length/alignment helper mismatch in message.Validate

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests craft a string/byte field at the signed gateway message envelope submitted to the public user endpoint whose alignment or length handling in `Validate` makes the parsed value differ from the signed value?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/api/message.go](core/services/gateway/api/message.go) -> `Validate`
- Entrypoint: the signed gateway message envelope submitted to the public user endpoint
- Attacker controls: field encoding and duplicate JSON keys (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `field encoding and duplicate JSON keys` with padding, embedded NULs or non-UTF8 bytes.
- Invariant to test: encode/decode must round-trip exactly for every input
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: round-trip fuzz-style table test over the alignment helpers
