# Q1173: kamino_deposit: deposit accounting mints too much internal value [same-slot-init-obligation-then] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `kamino_deposit` with same-slot init-obligation then deposit with changed auxiliary accounts so `kamino_deposit` credits more internal value than the external integration actually received, breaking `Kamino deposit must credit only the value truly deposited into the exact configured reserve/obligation context` and causing `Critical: phantom collateral credit or direct fund redirection`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/kamino/deposit.rs` / `kamino_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `kamino_deposit`
- Attacker controls: same-slot init-obligation then deposit with changed auxiliary accounts
- Exploit idea: Audit share conversions, fee-adjusted transfers, and rounding around CPI deposit accounting. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Kamino deposit must credit only the value truly deposited into the exact configured reserve/obligation context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom collateral credit or direct fund redirection
- Fast validation: Compare external protocol balances against marginfi internal balances after adversarial deposit amounts and assert no phantom value is minted. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
