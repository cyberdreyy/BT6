# Q4057: packet::recv_from_once — stream throttle bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through QUIC packets/transactions sent to the TPU by an unstaked client, reach `packet::recv_from_once` and open streams faster than stream_throttle allows so a single peer consumes disproportionate ingest capacity, so that the invariant "per-connection stream/byte rate is bounded on default config" is violated, leading to DoS (non-RPC)?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/packet.rs` -> `recv_from_once`
- Entrypoint: QUIC packets/transactions sent to the TPU by an unstaked client
- Attacker controls: the number and pacing of QUIC streams it opens
- Exploit idea: Open streams faster than stream_throttle allows so a single peer consumes disproportionate ingest capacity.
- Invariant to test: per-connection stream/byte rate is bounded on default config.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS (non-RPC) — High
- Fast validation: write a streamer/nonblocking test driving the crafted QUIC/packet pattern and asserting the rate/memory bound holds.
