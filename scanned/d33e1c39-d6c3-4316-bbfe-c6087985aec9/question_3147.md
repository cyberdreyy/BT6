# Q3147: json body serialised twice in get-wallet.ts

## Question
PrivyInternal.fetch JSON.stringifies the body while the signature covers the pre-serialisation object; can an attacker exploit serialisation differences (key order, unicode escaping, number formatting) so getWallet(): WalletGet by wallet_id signs one byte string and sends another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/get-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/get-wallet.ts) - getWallet(): WalletGet by wallet_id, returns additional_signers
- Entrypoint: addSessionSigners read-modify-write
- Attacker controls: wallet_id value and the returned additional_signers list used for the next write
- Exploit idea: Include unicode, large numbers and key orders that differ between canonicalize and JSON.stringify.
- Invariant to test: Signed and transmitted encodings must be byte-identical.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert canonicalize output and the transmitted body are byte-equal for getWallet(): WalletGet by wallet_id.
