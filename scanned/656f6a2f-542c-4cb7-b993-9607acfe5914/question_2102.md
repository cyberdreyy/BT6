# Q2102: undecodable responses counted as valid in callback.SendResponse

## Question
Does `SendResponse` at the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user count undecodable or error responses toward success, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests force a result with fewer honest contributions?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go) -> `SendResponse`
- Entrypoint: the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user
- Attacker controls: timing of late responses (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Trigger the mixed-response branch with `timing of late responses`.
- Invariant to test: only successfully decoded, verified responses may count
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test with mixed decodable/undecodable responses
