# Q2176: payment method mapping throws late in polling.ts

## Question
fundingMethodToMoonpayPaymentMethod throws for unsupported methods; can an attacker trigger that throw through getDeposit after the session or quote was already created?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Submit an unsupported funding method after initialisation.
- Invariant to test: Parameter validation must complete before any stateful call.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit an unsupported method to getDeposit and assert no prior state change.
