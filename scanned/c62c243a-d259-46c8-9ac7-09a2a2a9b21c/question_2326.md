# Q2326: authenticator response fields copied unchecked in maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts

## Question
maybeCreateWalletOnLogin's snake-case transformer copies id, raw_id, clientDataJSON, authenticatorData and userHandle straight through; can an attacker submit a response whose user_handle names another account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts](src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts) - maybeCreateWalletOnLogin, shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet, shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet, mergeUser
- Entrypoint: every auth.*.login* path after token storage
- Attacker controls: opts.embedded.{ethereum,solana}.createOnLogin, pre-existing linked wallets
- Exploit idea: Assemble an authenticator response object by hand and pass it to the login method.
- Invariant to test: src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts must not forward an assertion whose handle disagrees with the challenge it requested.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a response with a foreign user_handle and assert the SDK rejects before the network call.
