# Q1952: smart-wallet method chosen by address membership in index.ts

## Question
isCrossAppWalletSmart decides between personal_sign and privy_signSmartWalletMessage purely by address membership in smart_wallets; can an attacker cause the wrong method to be selected in crossApp action barrel: loginWithCrossAppAuth so the signature has different semantics than the user approved?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/index.ts](src/action/crossApp/index.ts) - crossApp action barrel: loginWithCrossAppAuth, linkWithCrossAppAuth, wallet.{signMessage,signTypedData,sendTransaction}
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.*
- Attacker controls: which dependency object (client, openAuthSession) is bound to each action
- Exploit idea: Place the address in both lists and observe the chosen method.
- Invariant to test: Signing method selection must be explicit and verified against the wallet type.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct an ambiguous account and assert crossApp action barrel: loginWithCrossAppAuth rejects rather than guessing.
