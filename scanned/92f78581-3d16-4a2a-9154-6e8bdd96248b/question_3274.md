# Q3274: cluster name switches the mint in generate.ts

## Question
getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster returns a different mint per cluster name; can an attacker pass a cluster name through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain that yields the devnet mint while the transfer executes on mainnet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Pass devnet while the transfer targets mainnet.
- Invariant to test: Cluster identity must be consistent across the whole funding flow.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross cluster names in generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain and assert consistency.
