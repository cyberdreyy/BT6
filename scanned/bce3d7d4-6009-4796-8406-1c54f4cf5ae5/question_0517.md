# Q0517: timestamp not validated on return in throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts

## Question
The request payload contains Date.now() but nothing verifies it on the way back; can an attacker replay an old cross-app response into throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts) - throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller
- Entrypoint: every crossApp.wallet action
- Attacker controls: the user object supplied by the caller rather than read from session
- Exploit idea: Capture a response and replay it for a later request.
- Invariant to test: Cross-app responses must be fresh and single-use.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: replay a captured response into throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller and assert rejection.
