# Q4477: legacy path skips new validation in bundler.setSignedResponse

## Question
Does the legacy message path in `setSignedResponse` at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user skip validation added on the JSON-RPC path, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests reach capability code with an under-validated request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `setSignedResponse`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: the request that determines bundle composition (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `request that determines bundle composition` through the legacy envelope.
- Invariant to test: both paths must apply identical validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: differential test across legacy and JSON-RPC paths
