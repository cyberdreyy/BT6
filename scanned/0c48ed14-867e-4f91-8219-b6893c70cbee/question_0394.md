# Q0394: canonicalize drops undefined fields in rpc.ts

## Question
generateAuthorizationSignature canonicalises the payload with canonicalize(), which omits undefined values and cannot represent them; can an attacker craft two semantically different payloads that canonicalise identically and reuse one signature for the other through rpc(): builds {version:1?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Build payloads differing only by undefined-valued or key-ordered fields and compare the canonical strings.
- Invariant to test: Canonicalisation must be injective over the payloads it authorises.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert rpc(): builds {version:1 produces distinct signatures for semantically distinct payloads.
