# Q0167: role wrapper omitted on a route in helpers.jsonAPIError

## Question
Is there a state-changing route reaching `jsonAPIError` from the JSON:API response writer used by every /v2 controller that is registered without RequiresEditRole/RequiresAdminRole, letting an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role invoke it with only view or run rights?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/helpers.go](core/web/helpers.go) -> `jsonAPIError`
- Entrypoint: the JSON:API response writer used by every /v2 controller
- Attacker controls: pagination parameters (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Enumerate registered routes and compare each handler's declared minimum role against its wrapper, then call the weakest one with `pagination parameters`.
- Invariant to test: every state-changing /v2 route must be wrapped by the role gate matching its side effect
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: reflective route-table test asserting each non-GET route carries a role middleware
