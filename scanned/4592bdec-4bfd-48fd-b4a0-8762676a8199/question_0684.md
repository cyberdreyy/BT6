# Q0684: refresh dedupe keyed by literal 'key' in UserApi.ts

## Question
refreshSession dedupes in-flight refreshes in a Map keyed by the refresh token, falling back to the literal 'key' when none exists; can an attacker make two different sessions share one in-flight refresh promise?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/UserApi.ts](src/client/UserApi.ts) - UserApi.get, switchActiveUser, acceptTerms
- Entrypoint: privy.user.switchActiveUser({userId})
- Attacker controls: userId string, timing against in-flight wallet operations
- Exploit idea: Trigger simultaneous refreshes with no refresh token present in multi-user mode and observe the shared cache entry.
- Invariant to test: Concurrent refreshes for different identities must never share a result.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two refreshes for different users with absent refresh tokens and assert two distinct requests are issued.
