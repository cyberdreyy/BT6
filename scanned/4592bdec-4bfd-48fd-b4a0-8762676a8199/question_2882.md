# Q2882: app config cached and trusted in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
AppApi memoises _smartWalletConfig and getConfig results; can an attacker cause PrivyInternal.fetch to keep serving a config fetched under a different app or user context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Fetch the config, change context, and observe the cached value still driving wallet behaviour.
- Invariant to test: Cached configuration must be invalidated when the app or session context changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: change appId and assert PrivyInternal.fetch refetches rather than returning the memoised config.
