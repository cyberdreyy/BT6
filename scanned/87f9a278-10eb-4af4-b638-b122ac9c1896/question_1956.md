# Q1956: moonpay currency defaults to ethereum mainnet in polling.ts

## Question
chainToMoonpayCurrency logs a warning and returns ETH_ETHEREUM for unknown chains; can an attacker route a user's purchase to Ethereum mainnet through getDeposit when they selected another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chainId and inspect the currency code.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported chains must abort rather than default.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an unsupported chain to getDeposit and assert an error.
