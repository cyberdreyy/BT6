# Q880: calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount: utility-derived authority selection can be reused in the wrong instruction family [mixed-internal-and-external-amount] [family-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route `juplend_deposit` through `calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount` with mixed internal and external amount domains across the same call so a utility-derived authority selection is reused in the wrong instruction family, violating `pre-fee and post-fee conversions must conserve value across internal accounting and external transfers` and causing `High: phantom internal value or understated debt through fee math drift`? Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `calculate_pre_fee_spl_deposit_amount`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: mixed internal and external amount domains across the same call
- Exploit idea: Helpers reused broadly across integrations are valuable places to look for cross-family authority confusion. Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.
- Invariant to test: pre-fee and post-fee conversions must conserve value across internal accounting and external transfers
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: phantom internal value or understated debt through fee math drift
- Fast validation: Call each consuming instruction with cross-family helper outputs and assert none accepts a foreign-family authority. Cross-substitute same-interface vaults, mints, and authorities and assert no utility-backed path accepts a foreign family.
