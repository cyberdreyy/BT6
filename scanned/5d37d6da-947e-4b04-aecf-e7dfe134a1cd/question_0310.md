# Q0310: caip2 prefix matching is loose in CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/funding/CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts](src/client/funding/CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts) - CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession, getStatus(partnerUserId)
- Entrypoint: privy.funding.coinbase.initOnRampSession(input)
- Attacker controls: the init body (addresses, assets, amount) and partnerUserId query value
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession and assert full-reference validation.
