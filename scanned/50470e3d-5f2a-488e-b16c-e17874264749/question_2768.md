# Q2768: switchActiveUser reloads the wallet iframe mid-operation in Token.ts

## Question
UserApi.switchActiveUser calls embedded.reload(), which flushes the shared callback queue; can an attacker use Token.parse to reject or hijack another in-flight wallet operation?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Start a signature, then switch users and observe the flush rejecting the pending callback.
- Invariant to test: A user switch must not be able to interfere with an unrelated in-flight signing operation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start a sign request, call Token.parse, and assert the pending request neither resolves with foreign data nor leaks its callback.
