# Q1993: chain id normalisation strips context in CustomProviderApi.ts

## Question
The chainId is normalised with replace('eip155:',''); can an attacker supply a chainId form that survives normalisation and makes the signed message describe a different chain than the one bound server-side?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts](src/client/auth/CustomProviderApi.ts) - CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken, linkWithToken
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.customProvider.syncWithToken(token, opts, mode)
- Attacker controls: the third-party JWT string, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Pass chainId values such as 'eip155:eip155:1' or '01' and inspect the resulting message.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity in the authentication message must be canonical and unambiguous.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: feed a table of chainId encodings to CustomProviderApi.syncWithToken and assert a single canonical output or a rejection.
