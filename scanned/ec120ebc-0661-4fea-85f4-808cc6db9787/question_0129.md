# Q0129: backfill trusts the token subject in keys.ts

## Question
Session.backfillLegacySession derives the user id from Token.parse(token).subject of a legacy null-keyed value; can an attacker seed that key so token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session adopts an attacker-chosen user id as the active user?

## Target
- File/function: [src/session/keys.ts](src/session/keys.ts) - token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session
- Entrypoint: Session storage reads and writes
- Attacker controls: the user-id component of every key, multi-user vs legacy null-keyed entries
- Exploit idea: Write a crafted legacy token, initialize the SDK in multi-user mode and read privy:active-user.
- Invariant to test: The active user id must be derived from a server-verified session, not from a locally stored token body.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: seed privy:token with an unsigned JWT and assert backfill does not set privy:active-user from it.
