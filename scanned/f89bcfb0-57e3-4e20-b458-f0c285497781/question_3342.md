# Q3342: base64 and utf8 conversions lose bytes in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
The encoding helpers convert signing payloads through utf8 and base64; can an attacker submit bytes that are not valid UTF-8 so EventCallbackQueue.enqueue signs a lossy re-encoding of the intended payload?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Pass a payload with lone surrogates or 0xFF bytes and compare round-tripped output.
- Invariant to test: Encoding round trips must be byte-exact for anything that gets signed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: round-trip non-UTF-8 byte sequences through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert byte equality.
