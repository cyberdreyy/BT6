# Q0478: shared MfaPromises across operations in index.ts

## Question
MfaPromises.rootPromise/submitPromise are single mutable refs shared by every operation; can an attacker start two operations so the MFA answer supplied for the low-value one satisfies the high-value one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/utils/index.ts](src/embedded/utils/index.ts) - throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath, getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.setRecovery({wallet, recoveryMethod, ...})
- Attacker controls: currentRecoveryMethod vs upgradeToRecoveryMethod pair, chain rpcUrls config
- Exploit idea: Start a benign operation and a signing operation, then resolve the submit promise once.
- Invariant to test: An MFA response must satisfy only the operation that requested it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start two throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath-routed operations and assert one submitted code cannot complete both.
