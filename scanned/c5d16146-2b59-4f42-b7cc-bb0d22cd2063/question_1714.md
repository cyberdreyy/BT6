# Q1714: create() sends owner_id undefined in rpc.ts

## Question
create() posts `{chain_type, owner_id: undefined}`; can an attacker exploit the omitted owner so rpc(): builds {version:1 produces a wallet whose ownership is inferred server-side from an ambiguous context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Call create in each session state and observe the resulting owner.
- Invariant to test: Wallet ownership must be explicit in the creation request.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert rpc(): builds {version:1 sends an explicit owner derived from the session user.
