# Q1361: entropyIdVerifier argument ignored in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletApi.getEthereumProvider forwards the caller's entropyId but constructs the provider with a hardcoded 'ethereum-address-verifier'; can an attacker exploit that mismatch through EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') so connect and rpc use inconsistent entropy identities?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Pass a solana verifier with an ethereum wallet and compare the connect and rpc payloads.
- Invariant to test: The entropy identity used to connect must be the identity used to sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') with a non-default verifier and assert the same verifier reaches every proxy call.
