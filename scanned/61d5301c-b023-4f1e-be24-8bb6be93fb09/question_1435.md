# Q1435: cost_tracker::would_fit — sanitize-vs-view divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `cost_tracker::would_fit` and make the SanitizedTransaction and the transaction-view/entry decode of the same bytes disagree, so that the invariant "every decode path yields identical account/privilege/instruction sets" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/cost_tracker.rs` -> `would_fit`
- Entrypoint: a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the raw serialized transaction bytes it submits
- Exploit idea: Make the SanitizedTransaction and the transaction-view/entry decode of the same bytes disagree.
- Invariant to test: every decode path yields identical account/privilege/instruction sets.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write a unit/fuzz test decoding the crafted message and assert sanitized privileges == enforced privileges.
