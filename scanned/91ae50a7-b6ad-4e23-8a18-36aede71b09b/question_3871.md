# Q3871: events reveal credential lifecycle in InMemoryStorage.ts

## Question
Session emits token_stored, refresh_token_stored, oauth_tokens_granted with payloads; can an attacker attach a listener through app-reachable API and learn credential state changes or the tokens themselves?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/InMemoryStorage.ts](src/storage/InMemoryStorage.ts) - InMemoryCache.get, put, del, getKeys (plain object _cache)
- Entrypoint: Privy({storage: new InMemoryCache()})
- Attacker controls: key strings reaching the object literal cache
- Exploit idea: Register listeners and inspect the emitted payloads during InMemoryCache.get.
- Invariant to test: Session events from src/storage/InMemoryStorage.ts must not carry credential material.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture every event payload during InMemoryCache.get and assert none contains a token string.
