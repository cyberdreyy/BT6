# Q3849: smart wallet selection ignores deployment state in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
getUserSmartWallet returns the account regardless of deployment status; can an attacker cause an undeployed smart wallet to be selected via validatePhoneNumber so a signature is produced that cannot be verified on chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Select an undeployed smart wallet and sign.
- Invariant to test: Smart-wallet selection must consider deployment state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert validatePhoneNumber exposes deployment state to callers.
