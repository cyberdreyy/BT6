# Q5975: path normalization mismatch in router.rateLimiter

## Question
Can an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port reach a protected handler through `rateLimiter` using a path variant (trailing slash, double slash, encoded segment) that the router matches but the role middleware does not?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/router.go](core/web/router.go) -> `rateLimiter`
- Entrypoint: any route registered by NewRouter/v2Routes/sessionRoutes/loopRoutes on the node API listener (default :6688)
- Attacker controls: the route path and HTTP verb (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `route path and HTTP verb` in normalized and non-normalized forms.
- Invariant to test: route matching and middleware application must operate on the same normalized path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: route test comparing handler execution across path variants
