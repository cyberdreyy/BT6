# Q2589: off-chain parser trusts the preamble in client.ts

## Question
parseSolanaOffchainMessage validates the 0xFF prefix and the 'solana offchain' text but returns version, format and signer bytes unchecked; can an attacker feed bytes through SolanaClient.invokeRpc so the parsed signer public key differs from the actual signer?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Parse a crafted buffer with an arbitrary signer field.
- Invariant to test: Parsed signer identity must be verified against the expected signer.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: parse a crafted buffer through SolanaClient.invokeRpc and assert the signer is validated.
