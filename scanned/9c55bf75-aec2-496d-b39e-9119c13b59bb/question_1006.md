# Q1006: concurrent login writes interleave active-user pointer in maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker race two every auth.*.login* path after token storage calls so storeActiveUserId writes user B while the later-resolving login stores user A's tokens under the null key, making privy:active-user point at the wrong credentials?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts](src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts) - maybeCreateWalletOnLogin, shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet, shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet, mergeUser
- Entrypoint: every auth.*.login* path after token storage
- Attacker controls: opts.embedded.{ethereum,solana}.createOnLogin, pre-existing linked wallets
- Exploit idea: Fire both logins, delay one response, then read getActiveUserId and getCustomerAccessToken.
- Invariant to test: privy:active-user and the null-keyed token copy must always describe the same subject.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: interleave two maybeCreateWalletOnLogin promises with controlled resolution order and assert Token.parse(getCustomerAccessToken()).subject === getActiveUserId().
