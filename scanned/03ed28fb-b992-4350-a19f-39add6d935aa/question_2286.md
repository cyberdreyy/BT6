# Q2286: moonpay sign input forwarded verbatim in polling.ts

## Question
MoonpayOnRampApi.sign posts the caller's input body to the signing route; can an attacker include a walletAddress in getDeposit that is not theirs so the signed on-ramp URL delivers funds elsewhere?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Submit a foreign wallet address in the sign input.
- Invariant to test: The funded address must be validated against the authenticated user's wallets.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a foreign address to getDeposit and assert rejection.
