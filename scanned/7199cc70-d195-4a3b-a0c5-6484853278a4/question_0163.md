# Q0163: from address defaults to the wallet in EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts

## Question
handlePopulateTransaction and handleEstimateGas use `transaction.from ?? this._account.address` while the signature is produced by the wallet regardless; can an attacker set a from that differs from the signer so the populated nonce and gas describe a different account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts) - EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.request, handleSignTransaction, handleSignAndSendTransaction, signMessageRpc, connectAndRecover
- Entrypoint: solanaProvider.request({method:'signAndSendTransaction', params:{transaction, connection, options}})
- Attacker controls: the Transaction/VersionedTransaction object, the connection object, options, message bytes
- Exploit idea: Send a transaction with a foreign from and compare the populated fields to the signing account.
- Invariant to test: Populated fields must be derived from the account that will actually sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign from to EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.request and assert rejection or that population uses the signer address.
