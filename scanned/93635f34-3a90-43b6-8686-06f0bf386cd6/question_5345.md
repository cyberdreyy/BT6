# Q5345: secret ownership check on the wrong field in workflow_metadata_handler.syncMetadata

## Question
Does the ownership check for a vault secret in `syncMetadata` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request use a request field rather than the recovered signer, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests read or overwrite another owner's secret?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `syncMetadata`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request` naming the victim's owner/namespace.
- Invariant to test: secret access must be authorized against the recovered signer only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test reading a foreign owner's secret
