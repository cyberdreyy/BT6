# Q3774: Creation onto an existing funded account - collides with tracked set

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker target a name whose derived account already exists and holds NEAR, so the batch fails after the transfer, with an id colliding with an entry already in the factory's tracked set, breaking the invariant that a failed creation strands no NEAR, and leading to protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it?

## Target
- File/function: `multisig-factory/src/lib.rs` - `MultisigFactory::create`
- Entrypoint: `create(name, members, num_confirmations)` - `#[payable]`, callable by ANY account
- Attacker controls: `name`, the full `members` list, `num_confirmations`, the deposit and the prepaid gas
- Exploit idea: Target a name whose derived account already exists and holds NEAR, so the batch fails after the transfer, with an id colliding with an entry already in the factory's tracked set.
- Invariant to test: A failed creation strands no NEAR.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - protocol accounting value diverges from reality and another party settles on it.
- Fast validation: Sim creation onto an existing account.
