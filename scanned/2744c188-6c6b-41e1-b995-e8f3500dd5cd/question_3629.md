# Q3629: no cross-check against the session user in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
validatePhoneNumber never compares the user object to the active session id; can an attacker pass a different user's object so the helper returns that user's wallets to the current session?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Pass another user's object during an active session.
- Invariant to test: Helpers must reject user objects that do not match the active session.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign user to validatePhoneNumber and assert refusal.
