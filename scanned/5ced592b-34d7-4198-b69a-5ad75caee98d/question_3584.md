# Q3584: wallet-api errors surface raw responses in rpc.ts

## Question
Errors from these routes are wrapped with code and error text; can an attacker trigger an error through rpc(): builds {version:1 whose message discloses another user's wallet identifiers?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Force error responses and inspect the propagated text.
- Invariant to test: Error text must not disclose identifiers of resources the caller does not own.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: force a 403 in rpc(): builds {version:1 and assert the surfaced error carries no foreign identifiers.
