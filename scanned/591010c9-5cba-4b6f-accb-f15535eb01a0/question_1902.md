# Q1902: get_pre_exec_account_rent_state confuses account types or owners (rent_calculator.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` in `svm/src/rent_calculator.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and have `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/rent_calculator.rs` -> `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state()` (around line 102)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_pre_exec_account_rent_state` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged client can receive balances, transaction status, or account data attributed to the wrong account, slot, fork, or commitment level, so wallets and exchanges credit or release value on state that is not final.
