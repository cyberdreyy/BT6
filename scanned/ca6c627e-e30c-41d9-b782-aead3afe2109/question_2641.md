# Q2641: identifier normalization mismatch in bundler.setSignedResponse

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests submit workflow identifiers at bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user whose normalization in `setSignedResponse` differs from the form used for authorization or accounting, so one identity authorizes and another executes?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/confidentialrelay/bundler.go) -> `setSignedResponse`
- Entrypoint: bundling of node responses returned to the requesting gateway user
- Attacker controls: repeat/duplicate requests (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `repeat/duplicate requests` in mixed-case/0x-less/padded hex.
- Invariant to test: the canonical form must be computed once and reused for both decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test asserting one canonical form is used for auth and execution
