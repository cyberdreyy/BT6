# Q2535: third-party auth blob forwarded verbatim in pkce.ts

## Question
generateState forwards the provider payload (web app data, auth result, token, or channel token) verbatim; can an attacker craft a payload whose embedded identity fields disagree with each other so the client-side flow proceeds on the wrong identity?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Assemble a payload with inconsistent identity fields and observe that the SDK performs no cross-field check before storing whatever session comes back.
- Invariant to test: src/pkce.ts must not treat an unvalidated provider payload as an identity assertion for its own session bookkeeping.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a payload with mismatched identity fields and assert generateState does not call updateWithTokensResponse without server confirmation of the same subject.
