# Q3057: solana usdc mint empty for testnet in poll.ts

## Question
SolanaUsdcAddressMap has an empty string for testnet while getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster throws for it; can an attacker reach the map-based path through poll: swallows operation errors so an empty mint address is used as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/poll.ts](src/utils/poll.ts) - poll: swallows operation errors, returns {status:'max_attempts'|'aborted'|'success'}
- Entrypoint: every deposit polling flow
- Attacker controls: operation results and errors, abort timing, attempt arithmetic
- Exploit idea: Select testnet and follow both code paths.
- Invariant to test: Missing mint data must fail closed on every path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: select testnet through poll: swallows operation errors and assert both paths error.
