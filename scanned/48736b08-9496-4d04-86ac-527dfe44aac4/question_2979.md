# Q2979: role attribute taken from the request in reaper.Work

## Question
Does the account/role creation path through `Work` at any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change accept the role from an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role's payload rather than from server policy?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go](core/sessions/localauth/reaper.go) -> `Work`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated /v2 request made after logout, password change or role change
- Attacker controls: timing of requests relative to session/token lifetime (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Include `timing of requests relative to session/token lifetime` with an elevated role field in the create/update body.
- Invariant to test: role assignment must be server-controlled and require admin authority
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: handler test posting a role field from a low-role session
