# Q0056: chain silently switched by tx.chainId in isVersionedTransaction.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletProvider.ensureChainId calls internalSwitchEthereumChain with the chainId found in the request params; can an unprivileged attacker submit a transaction through Solana provider transaction handling whose chainId silently repoints the provider and the RPC client to another chain before signing?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/isVersionedTransaction.ts](src/solana/isVersionedTransaction.ts) - isVersionedTransaction ('version' in tx)
- Entrypoint: Solana provider transaction handling
- Attacker controls: any object shaped to satisfy or defeat the 'version' in tx check
- Exploit idea: Send eth_sendTransaction with a chainId the user never selected and observe chainChanged plus the new client.
- Invariant to test: The provider chain must only change through an explicit wallet_switchEthereumChain approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call isVersionedTransaction ('version' in tx) with a foreign chainId and assert no silent switch and no signature.
