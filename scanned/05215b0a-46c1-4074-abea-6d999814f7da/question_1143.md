# Q1143: 15 second race leaves the callback registered in walletRpc.ts

## Question
The timeout helper rejects the caller but never dequeues the callback; can an attacker deliver a late reply through handleWalletApiRpc that settles a callback whose caller already gave up, corrupting later state?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Let an operation time out, then deliver the reply.
- Invariant to test: A timed-out operation must remove its callback so late replies are discarded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: time out an operation from handleWalletApiRpc, deliver the late reply and assert it is ignored.
