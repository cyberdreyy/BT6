# Q3452: wallet create returns before the user is refreshed in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
create()/add() call refreshSession after the iframe returns; can an attacker interleave a session change through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue so the created wallet is attributed to a different user object?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Change the active user between the iframe result and the refresh.
- Invariant to test: Wallet creation results must be attributed to the identity that requested them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch users mid-call in EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert the operation aborts.
