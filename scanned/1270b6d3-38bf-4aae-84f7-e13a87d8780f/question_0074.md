# Q0074: provider token placed in a URL query in getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts

## Question
sendCrossAppRequest builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<provider access token>&request=<json>`; can an unprivileged attacker cause that URL to be created through cross-app wallet operations so the bearer token leaks into browser history, referrers or logs?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink.ts) - getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink: cached token from storage else relink
- Entrypoint: cross-app wallet operations
- Attacker controls: the cached privy:cross-app:<appId> value and its decoded expiry
- Exploit idea: Trigger a cross-app wallet action and inspect the generated URL.
- Invariant to test: Bearer credentials must never be transported in a URL query string.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture the URL built by getProviderAccessTokenOrRelink: cached token from storage else relink and assert no token appears in the query.
