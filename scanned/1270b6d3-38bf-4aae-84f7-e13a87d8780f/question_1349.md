# Q1349: 20 second abort mid-write in toSearchParams.ts

## Question
toAbortSignalTimeout aborts requests at 20s; can an attacker time an abort so toSearchParams (skips null/undefined completes a partial storage mutation while the server-side effect still lands?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/toSearchParams.ts](src/utils/toSearchParams.ts) - toSearchParams (skips null/undefined, String() coercion)
- Entrypoint: PrivyInternal.getPath query building
- Attacker controls: query object values passed from public APIs
- Exploit idea: Delay the response past the abort and compare local state to server state.
- Invariant to test: An aborted request must leave local session state unchanged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort a refresh mid-flight and assert storage still matches the pre-request state.
