# Q0298: response type checked but payload trusted in signMessage.ts

## Question
sendCrossAppRequest validates privy_cross_app_type equals PRIVY_CROSS_APP_ACTION_RESPONSE and then returns privy_cross_app_payload verbatim; can an attacker return a payload through crossApp signMessage: params [message that the app treats as a signature or transaction hash without any verification?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts) - crossApp signMessage: params [message, address], method chosen by isCrossAppWalletSmart
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({user, address, message, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: message bytes/string, address, redirectUrl, provider response payload
- Exploit idea: Return a well-formed response with an arbitrary payload string.
- Invariant to test: A returned signature or hash must be verified against the request before being surfaced.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return an arbitrary payload from crossApp signMessage: params [message and assert verification before it is returned.
