# Q3012: solana rpc path only implements signMessage in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
walletRpc's solana branch handles signMessage and returns undefined for anything else; can an attacker exploit the undefined return in EventCallbackQueue.enqueue so a caller treats a failed operation as success?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Call an unsupported solana method and inspect the resolved value.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported operations must reject rather than resolve undefined.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call an unsupported method through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert it rejects.
