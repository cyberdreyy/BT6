# Q3978: saved-users JSON parsed leniently in Token.ts

## Question
getSavedUserIds JSON.parses the stored list and filters to strings, returning [] on failure; can an attacker seed a crafted list so Token.parse enumerates or switches to unintended ids?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Write a list containing crafted ids and call the switch path.
- Invariant to test: The saved-user list must be integrity-checked against stored credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: seed a foreign id and assert Token.parse rejects a switch to it.
