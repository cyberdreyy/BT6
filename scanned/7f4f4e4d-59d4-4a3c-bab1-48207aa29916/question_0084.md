# Q0084: refund address picked by chain-type scan in generate.ts

## Question
resolveRefundAddress maps the caip2 string to a chain type and then takes the FIRST linked_account of that chain type; can an unprivileged attacker cause an externally linked or attacker-influenced wallet to occupy that position so generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain sets it as the refund address for the victim's deposit?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Link an additional wallet of the same chain type and observe which address the refund resolution selects.
- Invariant to test: The refund address must be an embedded wallet the user explicitly selected, not the first matching linked account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: build a user whose first matching linked account is an external wallet and assert generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain requires an explicit refund selection.
