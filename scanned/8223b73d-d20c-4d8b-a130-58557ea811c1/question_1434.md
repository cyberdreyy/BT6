# Q1434: state code shared across simultaneous flows in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
privy:state_code and privy:code_verifier are single global keys; can an attacker cause OAuthApi.generateURL to consume a verifier written by a different, concurrently started flow?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Start a login OAuth flow and a recovery OAuth flow, then complete the first with the second's stored verifier.
- Invariant to test: Each authorization flow must consume only the PKCE material it generated.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: start two flows against one Storage and assert the second generateURL does not overwrite the first flow's verifier before it completes.
