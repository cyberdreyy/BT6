# Q1910: recovery key material fetched by address in EmbeddedWalletApi.ts

## Question
RecoveryApi.getRecoveryKeyMaterial takes an address path param and chain_type body; can an attacker request material for an address that is not theirs through EmbeddedWalletApi.create?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts](src/client/EmbeddedWalletApi.ts) - EmbeddedWalletApi.create, add, createSolana, setRecovery, delegateWallets, getProvider, getEthereumProvider, getSolanaProvider, getBitcoinProvider, _load, signWithUserSigner
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({...}) / .setRecovery({...}) / .getEthereumProvider({...})
- Attacker controls: recoveryMethod, password, recoveryKey, recoveryAccessToken, recoverySecretOverride, iCloudRecordNameOverride, entropyId, entropyIdVerifier, wallet object
- Exploit idea: Call the method with another user's wallet address.
- Invariant to test: Recovery material requests must be scoped to wallets owned by the authenticated user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: call EmbeddedWalletApi.create with a foreign address and assert the SDK refuses before the request.
