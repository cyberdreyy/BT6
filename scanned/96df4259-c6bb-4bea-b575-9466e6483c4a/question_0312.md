# Q0312: length/format validation gap in handler.addResponseForNode

## Question
Does the field validation in `addResponseForNode` at the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint accept an over-long, truncated or non-hex identifier that later code slices or parses unchecked, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address a different workflow?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go) -> `addResponseForNode`
- Entrypoint: the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint
- Attacker controls: signature over the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `signature over the request` at and beyond the documented length bounds.
- Invariant to test: every identifier must be length- and charset-validated before use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test at length boundaries for each identifier field
