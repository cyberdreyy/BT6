# Q3525: get_nonce_transaction_priority_id is not deterministic across nodes (transaction_state_container.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id` in `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/transaction_state_container.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and make the replay result on a fresh node disagree with the replay result on a node warm from cache, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/transaction_state_container.rs` -> `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id()` (around line 122)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_nonce_transaction_priority_id` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
