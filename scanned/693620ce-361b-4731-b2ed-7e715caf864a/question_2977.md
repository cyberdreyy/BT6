# Q2977: error path leaves tokens but no user in SiweApi.ts

## Question
When the post-login wallet creation step throws, does SiweApi.init leave the freshly stored tokens in place while never invoking setUser, leaving a live session the app believes does not exist?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts](src/client/auth/SiweApi.ts) - SiweApi.init, loginWithSiwe, linkWithSiwe, unlinkWallet, generateSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siwe.init(wallet, domain, uri) then loginWithSiwe(signature, wallet, message)
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, chainId, walletClientType, connectorType, full message override, signature
- Exploit idea: Force maybeCreateWalletOnLogin to reject and inspect storage and the app callback.
- Invariant to test: A login that does not complete must not leave usable credentials behind.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the create step reject and assert storage holds no privy:token afterwards.
