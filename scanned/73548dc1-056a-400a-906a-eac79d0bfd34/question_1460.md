# Q1460: passkey mfa options echo caller fields in withMfa.ts

## Question
MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions forwards the caller's input; can an attacker set relying-party or allowed-credential fields so the MFA ceremony accepts a credential they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/withMfa.ts](src/embedded/withMfa.ts) - withMfa retry loop (4 attempts, 300000ms per MFA wait, mfaAlwaysRequired flag)
- Entrypoint: every EmbeddedWalletProxy.invokeWithMfa operation
- Attacker controls: timing of mfa promise resolution, error types returned into the loop
- Exploit idea: Call withMfa retry loop (4 attempts with crafted options and inspect the ceremony parameters returned.
- Invariant to test: MFA ceremony parameters must be derived server-side from the enrolled credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass crafted options to withMfa retry loop (4 attempts and assert they are not forwarded.
