# Q1555: set_anticipated_count can be driven into unbounded work (bucket.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `set_anticipated_count` in `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make `set_anticipated_count` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `set_anticipated_count` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` -> `set_anticipated_count()` (around line 681)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `set_anticipated_count` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `set_anticipated_count` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `set_anticipated_count` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
