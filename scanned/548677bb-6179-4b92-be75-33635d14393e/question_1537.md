# Q1537: selection ignores wallet deletion state in shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts

## Question
shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user does not consider whether an account is disabled or pending; can an attacker cause a stale or disabled wallet to be selected for signing or funding?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts](src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts) - shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user, createOnLogin: 'off'|'users-without-wallets'|'all-users')
- Entrypoint: maybeCreateWalletOnLogin after every login
- Attacker controls: external wallets linked to the account and the createOnLogin setting
- Exploit idea: Include a disabled account and observe the selection.
- Invariant to test: Only usable accounts may be selectable.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: include a disabled account and assert shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user skips it.
