# Q0890: update flow accepts mismatched old/new identifiers in FarcasterApi.ts

## Question
In src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts, can an attacker submit an update request whose old identifier is not the one currently linked, so the code they hold is applied against a different identifier binding?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts) - FarcasterApi.initializeAuth, getFarcasterStatus, authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcaster.authenticate({channel_token, message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: channel_token header value, message, signature, fid, relying_party, redirect_url
- Exploit idea: Call the update method with an arbitrary old value plus a valid code for another identifier and observe client-side acceptance.
- Invariant to test: FarcasterApi.initializeAuth must bind the verification code to the exact identifier pair currently on the account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call the update method with mismatched old identifier and assert the SDK does not issue the request.
