# Q1462: passkey mfa options echo caller fields in MfaApi.ts

## Question
MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions forwards the caller's input; can an attacker set relying-party or allowed-credential fields so the MFA ceremony accepts a credential they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts) - MfaApi.verifyMfa, initEnrollMfa, submitEnrollMfa, unenrollMfa, unlinkPasskey, clearMfa
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.unenrollMfa(method) / privy.mfa.clearMfa({userId})
- Attacker controls: method argument, credentialId, removeAsMfa, userId, call ordering against refreshSession
- Exploit idea: Call MfaApi.verifyMfa with crafted options and inspect the ceremony parameters returned.
- Invariant to test: MFA ceremony parameters must be derived server-side from the enrolled credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass crafted options to MfaApi.verifyMfa and assert they are not forwarded.
