# Q4363: credentials written to logs in helpers.addForbiddenErrorHeaders

## Question
Does the request logging path near `addForbiddenErrorHeaders` record password, token, secret or key-export fields submitted to any /v2 or /query error response path, making them readable to anyone with log access obtained through a lower-severity bug?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/auth/helpers.go](core/web/auth/helpers.go) -> `addForbiddenErrorHeaders`
- Entrypoint: any /v2 or /query error response path
- Attacker controls: unknown IDs and type parameters (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `unknown IDs and type parameters` with credential-bearing field names not present in the redaction blacklist.
- Invariant to test: all credential-bearing fields must be redacted before logging
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: table test over the redaction helper with the full set of credential field names
