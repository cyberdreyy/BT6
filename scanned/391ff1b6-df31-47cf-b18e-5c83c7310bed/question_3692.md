# Q3692: resolver ignores soft-deleted state in mutation.DeleteCSAKey

## Question
Does `DeleteCSAKey` at POST /query mutation resolvers (bridges, keys, feeds managers, jobs, chains) resolve objects that are deleted/disabled, letting an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role act through a decommissioned bridge, key or manager?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/resolver/mutation.go](core/web/resolver/mutation.go) -> `DeleteCSAKey`
- Entrypoint: POST /query mutation resolvers (bridges, keys, feeds managers, jobs, chains)
- Attacker controls: the mutation name and input object (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Reference `mutation name and input object` for a deleted object.
- Invariant to test: resolvers must filter out deleted/disabled records
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: resolver test referencing deleted objects
