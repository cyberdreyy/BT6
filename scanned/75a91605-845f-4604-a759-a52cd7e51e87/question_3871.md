# Q3871: user enumeration then targeted attack in client.CreateEphemeralConnection

## Question
Do responses from `CreateEphemeralConnection` at POST /sessions against the configured LDAP server distinguish unknown accounts from wrong passwords precisely enough for an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port to enumerate operator accounts before credential attacks?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/ldapauth/client.go](core/sessions/ldapauth/client.go) -> `CreateEphemeralConnection`
- Entrypoint: POST /sessions against the configured LDAP server
- Attacker controls: username and password fields (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Compare status/body/timing for `username and password fields` across known and unknown accounts.
- Invariant to test: authentication failures must be uniform in content and timing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test comparing responses for known/unknown accounts
