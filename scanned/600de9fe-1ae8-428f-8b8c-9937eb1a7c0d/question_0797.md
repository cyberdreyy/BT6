# Q0797: session_update_action drives local state in Error.ts

## Question
_refreshSession applies set/clear/ignore purely from the response's session_update_action; can an attacker influence that field's handling so tokens are stored under the current user without confirming the subject?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Error.ts](src/Error.ts) - PrivyApiError, PrivyClientError, MoonpayApiError, createErrorFormatter, errorIndicatesMfaCanceled
- Entrypoint: every catch path in the SDK
- Attacker controls: error.code / error.message strings returned by any reachable response
- Exploit idea: Return a refresh response with 'set' and a user id different from the active one.
- Invariant to test: Applying a refresh result must verify the returned user matches the session being refreshed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a refresh payload for a different user and assert PrivyApiError refuses to store it.
