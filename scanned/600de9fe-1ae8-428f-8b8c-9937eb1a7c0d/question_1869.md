# Q1869: wei formatting strips trailing digits in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
formatWeiAmount fixes to three decimals and strips trailing zeros and dots; can an attacker choose an amount so validatePhoneNumber displays a materially smaller value than will be signed?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Format values just below the display precision.
- Invariant to test: Displayed amounts must never round down the value being approved.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert validatePhoneNumber never displays less than the true amount.
