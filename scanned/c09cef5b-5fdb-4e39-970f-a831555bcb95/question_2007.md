# Q2007: appId or clientId swapped at construction in Error.ts

## Question
Privy's constructor accepts appId, clientId, baseUrl, storage and crypto; can an attacker in the page reach PrivyApiError with substituted options so requests are signed and stored under a different app namespace?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Error.ts](src/Error.ts) - PrivyApiError, PrivyClientError, MoonpayApiError, createErrorFormatter, errorIndicatesMfaCanceled
- Entrypoint: every catch path in the SDK
- Attacker controls: error.code / error.message strings returned by any reachable response
- Exploit idea: Construct a second client with a different appId sharing the same storage and observe key collisions.
- Invariant to test: Storage namespacing must prevent one app id's session from being consumed by another.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two clients with different appIds over one Storage and assert no key collisions.
