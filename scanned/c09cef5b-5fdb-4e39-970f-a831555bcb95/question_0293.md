# Q0293: response type checked but payload trusted in sendCrossAppRequest.ts

## Question
sendCrossAppRequest validates privy_cross_app_type equals PRIVY_CROSS_APP_ACTION_RESPONSE and then returns privy_cross_app_payload verbatim; can an attacker return a payload through sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type that the app treats as a signature or transaction hash without any verification?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/sendCrossAppRequest.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/sendCrossAppRequest.ts) - sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type
- Entrypoint: any privy.crossApp.wallet.* call
- Attacker controls: the request payload, callbackUrl, and the privy_cross_app_type / privy_cross_app_payload pair returned to the SDK
- Exploit idea: Return a well-formed response with an arbitrary payload string.
- Invariant to test: A returned signature or hash must be verified against the request before being surfaced.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return an arbitrary payload from sendCrossAppRequest: builds `${provider_app_custom_api_url}/oauth/transact?communicationMode=redirect&token=<accessToken>&request=<json>` then validates privy_cross_app_type and assert verification before it is returned.
