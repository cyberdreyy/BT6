# Q2462: root wallet chosen by index order in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
getRootWallet returns the first ethereum wallet, else the first solana wallet; can an attacker influence linked-account ordering so EventCallbackQueue.enqueue delegates under a root wallet the user did not intend?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Construct a user with several embedded wallets and observe the root chosen.
- Invariant to test: Root-wallet selection must be explicit, not positional.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: build a user with multiple wallets and assert EventCallbackQueue.enqueue requires an explicit root selection.
