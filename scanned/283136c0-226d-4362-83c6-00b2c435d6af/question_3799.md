# Q3799: identity overwritten downstream in api.paginationLink

## Question
Can a later middleware or handler on the path through `paginationLink` overwrite the authenticated identity established at page/size query parameters on /v2 index endpoints using a request-controlled field?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/api.go](core/web/api.go) -> `paginationLink`
- Entrypoint: page/size query parameters on /v2 index endpoints
- Attacker controls: JSON:API document fields in the request body (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Include `JSON:API document fields in the request body` whose name collides with the context key or session field used downstream.
- Invariant to test: the authenticated identity must be immutable after the auth middleware
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: handler test injecting colliding body/header fields and asserting the identity is unchanged
