# Q3515: helpers accept partially hydrated users in getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets.ts

## Question
getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets: bitcoin-segwit and bitcoin-taproot filter tolerates a user object missing linked_accounts by returning an empty result; can an attacker exploit a partially hydrated user so a caller believes the user has no wallets and provisions a new one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets.ts](src/utils/getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets.ts) - getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets: bitcoin-segwit and bitcoin-taproot filter
- Entrypoint: Bitcoin provider selection
- Attacker controls: chain_type values on linked accounts
- Exploit idea: Pass a user with linked_accounts undefined.
- Invariant to test: Partially hydrated inputs must raise rather than yield empty results.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a partial user to getAllUserEmbeddedBitcoinWallets: bitcoin-segwit and bitcoin-taproot filter and assert it raises.
