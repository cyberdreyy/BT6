# Q3519: helpers accept partially hydrated users in phoneNumberUtils.ts

## Question
validatePhoneNumber tolerates a user object missing linked_accounts by returning an empty result; can an attacker exploit a partially hydrated user so a caller believes the user has no wallets and provisions a new one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts](src/utils/phoneNumberUtils.ts) - validatePhoneNumber, toE164 (falls back to stripping separators), lastFourDigits, getPhoneCountryCodeAndNumber (defaults to US/+1)
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.sendCode / loginWithCode input handling
- Attacker controls: the raw phone string, including unicode digits, extensions and country prefixes
- Exploit idea: Pass a user with linked_accounts undefined.
- Invariant to test: Partially hydrated inputs must raise rather than yield empty results.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a partial user to validatePhoneNumber and assert it raises.
