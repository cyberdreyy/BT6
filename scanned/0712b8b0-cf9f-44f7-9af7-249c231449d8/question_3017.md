# Q3017: solana rpc path only implements signMessage in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
walletRpc's solana branch handles signMessage and returns undefined for anything else; can an attacker exploit the undefined return in toWalletApiTypedData (types so a caller treats a failed operation as success?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Call an unsupported solana method and inspect the resolved value.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported operations must reject rather than resolve undefined.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call an unsupported method through toWalletApiTypedData (types and assert it rejects.
