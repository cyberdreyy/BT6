# Q2973: error path leaves tokens but no user in PhoneApi.ts

## Question
When the post-login wallet creation step throws, does PhoneApi.sendCode leave the freshly stored tokens in place while never invoking setUser, leaving a live session the app believes does not exist?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts](src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts) - PhoneApi.sendCode, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, updatePhone, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.loginWithCode(phone, code)
- Attacker controls: phoneNumber string (unnormalized), code, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Force maybeCreateWalletOnLogin to reject and inspect storage and the app callback.
- Invariant to test: A login that does not complete must not leave usable credentials behind.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the create step reject and assert storage holds no privy:token afterwards.
