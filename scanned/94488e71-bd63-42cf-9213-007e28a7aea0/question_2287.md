# Q2287: read route exposes a write-only field in replay_controller.ReplayFromBlock

## Question
Does the read path through `ReplayFromBlock` at POST /v2/replay_from_block/:number return a field intended to be write-only (token, password, secret, private URL) to an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin)?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/replay_controller.go](core/web/replay_controller.go) -> `ReplayFromBlock`
- Entrypoint: POST /v2/replay_from_block/:number
- Attacker controls: evmChainID and force query parameters (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'edit' role (non-admin); no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Fetch `evmChainID and force query parameters` after creating the object.
- Invariant to test: write-only fields must never be readable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: handler test asserting write-only fields are absent from reads
