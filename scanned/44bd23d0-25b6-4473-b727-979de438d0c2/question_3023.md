# Q3023: wallet-standard features called with an injected account in EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts

## Question
ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet spreads `{...input, account: this.#t}` into every feature call; can an attacker construct the wrapper with an account that does not match the underlying wallet so EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.request requests signatures for a foreign account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.ts) - EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.request, handleSignTransaction, handleSignAndSendTransaction, signMessageRpc, connectAndRecover
- Entrypoint: solanaProvider.request({method:'signAndSendTransaction', params:{transaction, connection, options}})
- Attacker controls: the Transaction/VersionedTransaction object, the connection object, options, message bytes
- Exploit idea: Construct the wrapper with a mismatched account/wallet pair.
- Invariant to test: The wrapped account must be verified to belong to the wrapped wallet.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct EmbeddedSolanaWalletProvider.request with a mismatched pair and assert construction fails.
