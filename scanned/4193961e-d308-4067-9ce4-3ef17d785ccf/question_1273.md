# Q1273: method name in envelope but not in body in generate-authorization-signature.ts

## Question
The envelope commits to the HTTP method and url, while the operation method (personal_sign, eth_signTransaction) lives in the body; can an attacker swap the body operation while keeping the same signed envelope via generateAuthorizationSignature: canonicalize(payload) -> utf8 -> base64?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/generate-authorization-signature.ts](src/wallet-api/generate-authorization-signature.ts) - generateAuthorizationSignature: canonicalize(payload) -> utf8 -> base64, or raw base64 for Uint8Array
- Entrypoint: every TEE wallet-api request signed with the user signer
- Attacker controls: the payload object fields that reach canonicalize, and any field canonicalize drops
- Exploit idea: Reuse a signature across two body variants that share url and method.
- Invariant to test: Signed material must cover the semantic operation, not just the transport.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: reuse the generateAuthorizationSignature: canonicalize(payload) -> utf8 -> base64 signature with a modified body and assert rejection.
