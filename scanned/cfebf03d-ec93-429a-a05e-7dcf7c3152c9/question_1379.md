# Q1379: typed data accepted as a JSON string in client.ts

## Question
toWalletApiTypedData JSON.parses string input before use; can an attacker pass a string whose parse result differs from what the app displayed, so SolanaClient.invokeRpc signs different typed data?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Pass a JSON string with duplicate keys or unusual escaping and compare the parsed structure.
- Invariant to test: String and object inputs must produce identical, validated structures.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass duplicate-key JSON to SolanaClient.invokeRpc and assert deterministic, validated parsing.
