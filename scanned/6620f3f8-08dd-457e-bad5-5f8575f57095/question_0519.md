# Q0519: timestamp not validated on return in signTypedData.ts

## Question
The request payload contains Date.now() but nothing verifies it on the way back; can an attacker replay an old cross-app response into crossApp signTypedData: params [address?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts) - crossApp signTypedData: params [address, generateDomainType(typedData)]
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signTypedData({user, typedData, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the whole typedData object including domain and types
- Exploit idea: Capture a response and replay it for a later request.
- Invariant to test: Cross-app responses must be fresh and single-use.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: replay a captured response into crossApp signTypedData: params [address and assert rejection.
