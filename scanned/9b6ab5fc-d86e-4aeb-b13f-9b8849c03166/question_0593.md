# Q0593: error branch forges a wallet error in walletRpc.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages routes any reply with an error field into reject(new PrivyIframeError(type, message)); can an attacker deliver an error reply with type 'wallet_not_on_device' so handleWalletApiRpc starts a recovery flow?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Post an error reply with the recovery-triggering type for a pending connect.
- Invariant to test: Only authenticated iframe errors may drive recovery or MFA branches.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: deliver a forged error reply through handleWalletApiRpc and assert no recovery is attempted.
