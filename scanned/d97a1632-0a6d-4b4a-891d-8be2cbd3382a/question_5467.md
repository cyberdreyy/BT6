# Q5467: error response discloses secret material in message_util.ValidatedResponseFromMessage

## Question
Do error paths in `ValidatedResponseFromMessage` at validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses include node responses, partial plaintext or key identifiers that reveal secret material to any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go) -> `ValidatedResponseFromMessage`
- Entrypoint: validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses
- Attacker controls: encoding variants of identifiers (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Force partial failure with `encoding variants of identifiers`.
- Invariant to test: error paths must not carry node payloads to the user
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test asserting error payloads exclude node data
