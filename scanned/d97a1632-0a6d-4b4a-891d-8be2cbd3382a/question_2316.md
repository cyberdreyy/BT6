# Q2316: in-flight request map keyed without sender in handler.addResponseForNode

## Question
Is the in-flight request map used by `addResponseForNode` at the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint keyed without the authenticated sender, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests evict, complete or read another user's entry?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go) -> `addResponseForNode`
- Entrypoint: the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint
- Attacker controls: owner/namespace/secret identifier fields (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `owner/namespace/secret identifier fields` colliding with the victim's key.
- Invariant to test: in-flight state must be namespaced by verified sender
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: test asserting cross-sender key isolation
