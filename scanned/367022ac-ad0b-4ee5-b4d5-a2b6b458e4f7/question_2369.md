# Q2369: off-chain domain truncated to 32 bytes in client.ts

## Question
deriveSolanaApplicationDomain copies the first 32 UTF-8 bytes of the origin into the application domain; can an attacker register a longer origin that collides with the victim's origin after truncation so SolanaClient.invokeRpc produces messages the victim's verifier accepts?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Find two origins sharing a 32-byte prefix and compare derived domains.
- Invariant to test: The application domain must be collision-resistant over origins.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert two distinct origins never produce the same domain from SolanaClient.invokeRpc.
