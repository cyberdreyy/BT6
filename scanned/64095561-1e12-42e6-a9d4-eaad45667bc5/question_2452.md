# Q2452: mfa cancelled treated as success in MfaApi.ts

## Question
errorIndicatesMfaCanceled checks error.code === 'mfa_canceled'; can an attacker make MfaApi.verifyMfa treat a cancellation as a benign outcome so the calling app proceeds as if the operation was authorised?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts) - MfaApi.verifyMfa, initEnrollMfa, submitEnrollMfa, unenrollMfa, unlinkPasskey, clearMfa
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.unenrollMfa(method) / privy.mfa.clearMfa({userId})
- Attacker controls: method argument, credentialId, removeAsMfa, userId, call ordering against refreshSession
- Exploit idea: Cancel an MFA prompt mid-operation and inspect what the operation returns.
- Invariant to test: A cancelled MFA must produce a failure the app cannot mistake for approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: cancel during MfaApi.verifyMfa and assert the returned promise rejects.
