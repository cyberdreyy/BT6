# Q3298: solana and ethereum lists share the predicate in shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet.ts

## Question
Both list helpers use the same embedded predicate with a chain filter; can an attacker produce an account whose chain_type is absent so it is excluded from both lists yet still signable?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet.ts](src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet.ts) - shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet(user, createOnLogin)
- Entrypoint: maybeCreateWalletOnLogin after every login
- Attacker controls: linked solana accounts and the createOnLogin setting
- Exploit idea: Omit chain_type on an embedded account.
- Invariant to test: Every signable account must appear in exactly one enumeration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: omit chain_type and assert shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet(user surfaces the account or rejects it.
