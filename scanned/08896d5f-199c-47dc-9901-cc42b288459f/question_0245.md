# Q0245: destroyLocalState misses non-active users in AppApi.ts

## Question
destroyLocalState deletes the null-keyed entries plus only the active user's keys; after AppApi.getConfig, can credentials for other saved users remain readable on the device?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Log in as two users, clear state, then enumerate storage keys.
- Invariant to test: A credential clear must remove every stored session the SDK created.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: store two users, call destroyLocalState, assert getKeys() has no privy:*:refresh_token left.
