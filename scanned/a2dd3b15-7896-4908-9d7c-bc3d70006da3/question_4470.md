# Q4470: legacy path skips new validation in handler.sendHTTPMessageToClient

## Question
Does the legacy message path in `sendHTTPMessageToClient` at web-API trigger and outgoing-request handling on the public gateway user endpoint skip validation added on the JSON-RPC path, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests reach capability code with an under-validated request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/handler.go) -> `sendHTTPMessageToClient`
- Entrypoint: web-API trigger and outgoing-request handling on the public gateway user endpoint
- Attacker controls: repeated or concurrent submissions (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `repeated or concurrent submissions` through the legacy envelope.
- Invariant to test: both paths must apply identical validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: differential test across legacy and JSON-RPC paths
