# Q0673: run input reaches the reported value in log_controller.Patch

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role supply request data through `Patch` at GET and PATCH /v2/log that flows into the value the job reports on-chain rather than being confined to metadata?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/log_controller.go](core/web/log_controller.go) -> `Patch`
- Entrypoint: GET and PATCH /v2/log
- Attacker controls: logLevel and sqlEnabled fields (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `logLevel and sqlEnabled fields` with crafted pipeline input/meta.
- Invariant to test: externally supplied run input must not determine the reported observation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: pipeline test asserting the reported value is independent of caller-supplied input
