# Q2148: options forwarded to the broadcaster in ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts

## Question
The options argument is passed to sendRawTransaction unchecked; can an attacker set options through ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage that suppress preflight and hide a failing or malicious transaction?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts](src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts) - ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage, signTransaction, signAndSendTransaction, signAndSendAllTransactions, disconnect (account injected into every feature call)
- Entrypoint: new ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet({wallet, account}) then sign*
- Attacker controls: the inputs spread into the wallet-standard feature calls and the returned array shape
- Exploit idea: Send skipPreflight and non-default commitment values.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast options that affect safety checks must be constrained.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage pins preflight-relevant options.
