# Q3095: logout does not await server revocation in SmartWalletApi.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout swallows the Logout request error before clearing local state; can an attacker abuse this so the refresh token stays valid server-side while the app reports a completed logout?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts](src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts) - SmartWalletApi.init, link, generateSmartWalletSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.smartWallet.init(wallet) then link(message, signature, type, version)
- Attacker controls: message override, signature, smart_wallet_type, smart_wallet_version, chainId
- Exploit idea: Make the Logout route fail and then reuse the previously captured refresh token.
- Invariant to test: A completed logout must guarantee server-side revocation or surface the failure.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: fail the Logout route, assert SmartWalletApi.init surfaces the failure instead of resolving silently.
