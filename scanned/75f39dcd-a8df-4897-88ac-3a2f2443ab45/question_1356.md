# Q1356: sms code request unbounded by target in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
MfaSmsApi.sendCode forwards the caller's input body; can an attacker direct the code to a number that is not the account's registered factor via RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Call sendCode with an arbitrary destination in the input.
- Invariant to test: The MFA delivery target must be server-selected from the enrolled factor, not caller-supplied.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an arbitrary destination to RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert it is not included in the request.
