# Q2732: init body carries the destination address in moonpay.ts

## Question
initOnRampSession forwards the caller's body including addresses and assets; can an attacker submit a destination through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay that is not the user's wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/moonpay.ts](src/funding/moonpay.ts) - isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay, chainToMoonpayCurrency (defaults to ETH_ETHEREUM on unknown chain), fundingMethodToMoonpayPaymentMethod
- Entrypoint: MoonPay funding parameter construction
- Attacker controls: chainId and asset arguments
- Exploit idea: Submit a foreign address in the init body.
- Invariant to test: Funding destinations must be validated against the user's wallets.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a foreign address to isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay and assert rejection.
