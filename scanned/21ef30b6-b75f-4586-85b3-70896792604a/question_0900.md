# Q0900: custom_api_url from app config redirects all traffic in LocalStorage.ts

## Question
PrivyInternal._initialize sets baseUrl from config.custom_api_url and flips isUsingServerCookies; can an unprivileged attacker influence that value so bearer tokens are sent to a different host?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/LocalStorage.ts](src/storage/LocalStorage.ts) - LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse), put (JSON.stringify), del, getKeys
- Entrypoint: every Session/pkce/crossApp storage operation
- Attacker controls: any value another SDK surface can write under a privy: key on the same origin
- Exploit idea: Serve an app config with a custom_api_url and observe subsequent authenticated requests targeting it.
- Invariant to test: The API base URL must be pinned to a trusted set, not taken from a fetched config field.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return custom_api_url pointing elsewhere and assert LocalStorage.get (JSON.parse) does not send Authorization headers to that host.
