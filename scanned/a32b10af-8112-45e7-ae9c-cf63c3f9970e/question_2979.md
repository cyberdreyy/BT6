# Q2979: error path leaves tokens but no user in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
When the post-login wallet creation step throws, does createSiwsMessage({address leave the freshly stored tokens in place while never invoking setUser, leaving a live session the app believes does not exist?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Force maybeCreateWalletOnLogin to reject and inspect storage and the app callback.
- Invariant to test: A login that does not complete must not leave usable credentials behind.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the create step reject and assert storage holds no privy:token afterwards.
