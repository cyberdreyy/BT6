# Q3456: wallet create returns before the user is refreshed in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
create()/add() call refreshSession after the iframe returns; can an attacker interleave a session change through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction so the created wallet is attributed to a different user object?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Change the active user between the iframe result and the refresh.
- Invariant to test: Wallet creation results must be attributed to the identity that requested them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch users mid-call in toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert the operation aborts.
