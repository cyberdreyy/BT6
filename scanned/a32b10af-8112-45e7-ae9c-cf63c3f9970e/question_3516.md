# Q3516: helpers accept partially hydrated users in getUserSmartWallet.ts

## Question
getUserSmartWallet: first linked account of type smart_wallet tolerates a user object missing linked_accounts by returning an empty result; can an attacker exploit a partially hydrated user so a caller believes the user has no wallets and provisions a new one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getUserSmartWallet.ts](src/utils/getUserSmartWallet.ts) - getUserSmartWallet: first linked account of type smart_wallet
- Entrypoint: smart-wallet routing and linking
- Attacker controls: linked_accounts contents including multiple smart wallets
- Exploit idea: Pass a user with linked_accounts undefined.
- Invariant to test: Partially hydrated inputs must raise rather than yield empty results.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a partial user to getUserSmartWallet: first linked account of type smart_wallet and assert it raises.
