# Q2165: payload echoed unvalidated into the response in http_handler.NewGatewayHandler

## Question
Does `NewGatewayHandler` at the v2 gateway HTTP handler (HandleJSONRPCUserMessage/makeOutgoingRequest) echo attacker-supplied request fields into the user response or into a signed artifact, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests shape data another party trusts?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_handler.go) -> `NewGatewayHandler`
- Entrypoint: the v2 gateway HTTP handler (HandleJSONRPCUserMessage/makeOutgoingRequest)
- Attacker controls: the JSON-RPC method and params (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `JSON-RPC method and params` with crafted echoable fields.
- Invariant to test: responses must contain only server/DON-derived values
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: test asserting no request field is echoed into signed output
