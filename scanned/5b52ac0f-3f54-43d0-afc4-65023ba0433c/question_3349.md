# Q3349: request id mismatch tolerated in callback.Wait

## Question
Does `Wait` at the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user tolerate a mismatch between the id inside a signed payload and the id of the request being answered, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests splice a response from another request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go) -> `Wait`
- Entrypoint: the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user
- Attacker controls: identifiers used to select the callback (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `identifiers used to select the callback` whose ids differ.
- Invariant to test: the signed id must equal the served request id
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test asserting mismatched ids are rejected
