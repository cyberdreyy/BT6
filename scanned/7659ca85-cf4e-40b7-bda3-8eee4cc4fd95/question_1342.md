# Q1342: 20 second abort mid-write in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
toAbortSignalTimeout aborts requests at 20s; can an attacker time an abort so PrivyInternal.fetch completes a partial storage mutation while the server-side effect still lands?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Delay the response past the abort and compare local state to server state.
- Invariant to test: An aborted request must leave local session state unchanged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort a refresh mid-flight and assert storage still matches the pre-request state.
