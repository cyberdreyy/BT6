# Q1814: get_prioritization_fee crashes the process from one request (compute_budget_limits.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `get_prioritization_fee` in `compute-budget/src/compute_budget_limits.rs` with amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates, and make `get_prioritization_fee` panic, abort, or block the runtime from that single request, so that the invariant "No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response." breaks and the result is RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget/src/compute_budget_limits.rs` -> `get_prioritization_fee()` (around line 56)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates
- Exploit idea: Send one request whose parameters make `get_prioritization_fee` panic, abort, or block the runtime, taking down the validator rather than only the RPC thread.
- Invariant to test: No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash - single low-rate call from one client crashes or stalls the node (20-65 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz the request parameters against `get_prioritization_fee` and assert every case returns an error response and the process survives.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
