# Q1637: retry amplification per request in webapi.Validate

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests make one accepted request at the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint cause repeated node work through the retry logic near `Validate`, multiplying DON execution per unit of entitlement?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/webapi.go) -> `Validate`
- Entrypoint: the web-API capability handler config validation and request path from the public gateway endpoint
- Attacker controls: rate/quota-relevant fields (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `rate/quota-relevant fields` that never reaches a terminal state.
- Invariant to test: retries must be bounded per request and counted against the caller's quota
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test counting node messages produced by one user request
