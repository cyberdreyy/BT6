# Q3982: shard selection redirects execution in message_util.ValidatedMessageFromReq

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests influence the shard/DON chosen by `ValidatedMessageFromReq` at validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses so their request executes on a shard that does not enforce the same authorization?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go) -> `ValidatedMessageFromReq`
- Entrypoint: validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses
- Attacker controls: response fields echoed from the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `response fields echoed from the request` with crafted shard-selecting fields.
- Invariant to test: shard selection must not alter the authorization decision
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test asserting identical authorization across shards
