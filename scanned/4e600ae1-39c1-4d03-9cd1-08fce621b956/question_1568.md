# Q1568: transaction_processor::execute_loaded_transaction — fee charge divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `transaction_processor::execute_loaded_transaction` and construct a transaction where the fee charged/collected differs from the fee computed, or diverges across nodes, so that the invariant "fees are computed and charged identically and exactly once per transaction" is violated, leading to Loss of Funds / Consensus?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` -> `execute_loaded_transaction`
- Entrypoint: a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the fee-payer, compute-budget price and signature layout it submits
- Exploit idea: Construct a transaction where the fee charged/collected differs from the fee computed, or diverges across nodes.
- Invariant to test: fees are computed and charged identically and exactly once per transaction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds / Consensus — Critical
- Fast validation: write an SVM/bank test running the transaction twice and asserting deterministic, exact fee/rollback/rent accounting.
