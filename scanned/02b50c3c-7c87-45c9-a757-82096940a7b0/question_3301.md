# Q3301: group-to-role mapping too permissive in client.CreateEphemeralConnection

## Question
Does the group-to-role mapping performed by `CreateEphemeralConnection` at POST /sessions against the configured LDAP server grant an elevated role on a partial, case-insensitive or substring match, letting an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port in a low-privilege group obtain admin?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/ldapauth/client.go](core/sessions/ldapauth/client.go) -> `CreateEphemeralConnection`
- Entrypoint: POST /sessions against the configured LDAP server
- Attacker controls: username and password fields (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Authenticate with `username and password fields` from a group whose name embeds the privileged group name.
- Invariant to test: group mapping must be an exact match against the configured DN/claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test mapping crafted group names to roles
