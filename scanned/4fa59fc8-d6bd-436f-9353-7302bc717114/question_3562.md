# Q3562: solana create takes an ethereum account argument in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
createSolana accepts an ethereumAccount whose provider is loaded first; can an attacker pass a foreign ethereum account through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue so entropy from another wallet is used for the new Solana wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Call createSolana with an ethereum account object that is not the user's.
- Invariant to test: Cross-chain wallet derivation must use only the authenticated user's own accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign ethereum account to EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert rejection.
