# Q3380: communicationMode fixed to redirect in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
The transact URL pins communicationMode=redirect; can an attacker exploit the redirect mode through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] so credentials or results traverse the browser address bar where other parties observe them?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Trace what appears in the address bar and referrer during the flow.
- Invariant to test: Sensitive cross-app material must not traverse navigable URLs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] carries the token out-of-band rather than in the navigation.
