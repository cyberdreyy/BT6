# Q1366: entropyIdVerifier argument ignored in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
EmbeddedWalletApi.getEthereumProvider forwards the caller's entropyId but constructs the provider with a hardcoded 'ethereum-address-verifier'; can an attacker exploit that mismatch through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction so connect and rpc use inconsistent entropy identities?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Pass a solana verifier with an ethereum wallet and compare the connect and rpc payloads.
- Invariant to test: The entropy identity used to connect must be the identity used to sign.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction with a non-default verifier and assert the same verifier reaches every proxy call.
