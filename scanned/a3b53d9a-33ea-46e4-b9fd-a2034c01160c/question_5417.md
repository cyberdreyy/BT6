# Q5417: state parameter not verified in authentication.AuthenticationProvider

## Question
Is the state/nonce checked by `AuthenticationProvider` at POST /sessions and every AuthenticationProvider call behind /v2 auth unbound to the initiating browser session, letting an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port inject their own authorization code and take over the resulting node session?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/authentication.go](core/sessions/authentication.go) -> `AuthenticationProvider`
- Entrypoint: POST /sessions and every AuthenticationProvider call behind /v2 auth
- Attacker controls: submitted email and password (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Deliver `submitted email and password` with an attacker-obtained code and a replayed state.
- Invariant to test: state must be single-use and bound to the initiating session
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: handler test replaying state/code pairs across sessions
