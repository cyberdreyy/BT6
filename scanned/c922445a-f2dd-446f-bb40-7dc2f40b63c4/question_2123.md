# Q2123: field_offset panics on attacker-reachable input (frame_v1_14_11.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `field_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `field_offset`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` -> `field_offset()` (around line 48)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Reach `field_offset` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `field_offset` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
