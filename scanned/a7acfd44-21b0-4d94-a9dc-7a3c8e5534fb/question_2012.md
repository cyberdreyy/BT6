# Q2012: icloud configuration drives recovery choice in MfaApi.ts

## Question
RecoveryICloudApi.getICloudConfiguration returns configuration consumed as trusted; can an attacker influence the returned configuration so MfaApi.verifyMfa performs recovery against an attacker-chosen record?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts](src/client/mfa/MfaApi.ts) - MfaApi.verifyMfa, initEnrollMfa, submitEnrollMfa, unenrollMfa, unlinkPasskey, clearMfa
- Entrypoint: privy.mfa.unenrollMfa(method) / privy.mfa.clearMfa({userId})
- Attacker controls: method argument, credentialId, removeAsMfa, userId, call ordering against refreshSession
- Exploit idea: Return a configuration naming a foreign record name and observe the recovery attempt.
- Invariant to test: Recovery targets must be bound to the authenticated user's own records.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign record configuration and assert MfaApi.verifyMfa refuses to use it.
