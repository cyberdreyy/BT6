# Q2528: password verification skipped on missing user in user.ValidateEmail

## Question
Does `ValidateEmail` skip or short-circuit hash verification when the user row is absent or has an empty password hash, letting an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port authenticate at POST /sessions and PATCH /v2/user/password against a non-existent or partially provisioned account?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/user.go](core/sessions/user.go) -> `ValidateEmail`
- Entrypoint: POST /sessions and PATCH /v2/user/password
- Attacker controls: email string (unicode, case, whitespace) (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `email string (unicode, case, whitespace)` for an unknown or externally-managed account.
- Invariant to test: authentication must fail closed and always perform a full hash comparison
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test asserting a constant-time failure for unknown users and empty hashes
