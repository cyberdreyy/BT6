# Q3248: disconnect leaves the wrapper usable in ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts

## Question
disconnect only calls the standard feature; can an attacker keep using ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage after disconnect so signatures are still requested from a wallet the user disconnected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts](src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts) - ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage, signTransaction, signAndSendTransaction, signAndSendAllTransactions, disconnect (account injected into every feature call)
- Entrypoint: new ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet({wallet, account}) then sign*
- Attacker controls: the inputs spread into the wallet-standard feature calls and the returned array shape
- Exploit idea: Call disconnect then sign.
- Invariant to test: A disconnected wallet wrapper must refuse further operations.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call disconnect then sign through ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage and assert rejection.
