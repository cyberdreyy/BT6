# Q0060: signature not covering all authorization fields in codec.Codec

## Question
Does the signature validated on the path through `Codec` at the encode/decode boundary for gateway user requests and responses cover every field used for authorization (sender, method, donId, receiver, payload), or can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests mutate an uncovered field after signing?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/api/codec.go](core/services/gateway/api/codec.go) -> `Codec`
- Entrypoint: the encode/decode boundary for gateway user requests and responses
- Attacker controls: the raw request bytes (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Sign one message, then alter `raw request bytes` before sending.
- Invariant to test: the signed digest must commit to every field later used for routing or authorization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test mutating each field of a signed message and asserting rejection
