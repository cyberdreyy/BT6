# Q3055: solana usdc mint empty for testnet in resolve-refund-address.ts

## Question
SolanaUsdcAddressMap has an empty string for testnet while getSolanaUsdcMintAddressForCluster throws for it; can an attacker reach the map-based path through resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type so an empty mint address is used as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/resolve-refund-address.ts](src/action/depositAddress/resolve-refund-address.ts) - resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type, else creates a wallet via WalletCreate
- Entrypoint: deposit-address generation without an explicit refundAddress
- Attacker controls: the caip2 string, the ordering/content of user.linked_accounts, onWalletCreated callback
- Exploit idea: Select testnet and follow both code paths.
- Invariant to test: Missing mint data must fail closed on every path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: select testnet through resolveRefundAddress: caip2ToChainType then first linked_account of that chain_type and assert both paths error.
