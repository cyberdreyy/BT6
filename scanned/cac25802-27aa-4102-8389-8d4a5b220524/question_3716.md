# Q3716: onWalletCreated callback fires before confirmation in polling.ts

## Question
resolveRefundAddress invokes onWalletCreated after the create call returns; can an attacker use getDeposit so the app treats an unconfirmed wallet as ready and routes funds to it?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Return a create response and inspect the callback timing versus session refresh.
- Invariant to test: Callbacks signalling readiness must follow a confirmed session refresh.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert getDeposit refreshes the user before invoking the callback.
