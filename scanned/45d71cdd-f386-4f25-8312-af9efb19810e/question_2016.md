# Q2016: icloud configuration drives recovery choice in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
RecoveryICloudApi.getICloudConfiguration returns configuration consumed as trusted; can an attacker influence the returned configuration so RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL performs recovery against an attacker-chosen record?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Return a configuration naming a foreign record name and observe the recovery attempt.
- Invariant to test: Recovery targets must be bound to the authenticated user's own records.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign record configuration and assert RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL refuses to use it.
