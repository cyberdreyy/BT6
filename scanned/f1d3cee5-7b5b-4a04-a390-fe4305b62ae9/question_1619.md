# Q1619: openAuthSession is an injected dependency in signTypedData.ts

## Question
The action factories take openAuthSession from the caller; can an attacker supply an implementation through crossApp signTypedData: params [address that observes the authorization URL and the returned code?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts) - crossApp signTypedData: params [address, generateDomainType(typedData)]
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signTypedData({user, typedData, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the whole typedData object including domain and types
- Exploit idea: Inject a logging implementation and inspect what it sees.
- Invariant to test: The auth-session transport must be trusted and not carry credentials it can retain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert crossApp signTypedData: params [address does not pass reusable credentials through the injected transport.
