# Q0391: broadcast through a caller-influenced RPC in unified-wallet.ts

## Question
handleSendTransaction broadcasts with eth_sendRawTransaction through the viem client built by getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain, which prefers rpcUrls.privyWalletOverride then the supportedChains config; can an attacker supply a chain entry through branch selector between TEE wallet-api path and on-device iframe path so the signed transaction is sent to an endpoint they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/unified-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/unified-wallet.ts) - isUnifiedWallet (account.id && recovery_method === 'privy-v2')
- Entrypoint: branch selector between TEE wallet-api path and on-device iframe path
- Attacker controls: the linked-account object fields id and recovery_method
- Exploit idea: Construct the client with a supportedChains entry carrying an override RPC and observe the broadcast target.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast endpoints must come from a trusted, pinned configuration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a chain with a crafted override to isUnifiedWallet (account.id && recovery_method === 'privy-v2') and assert the broadcast target is the trusted endpoint.
