# Q1276: method name in envelope but not in body in create.ts

## Question
The envelope commits to the HTTP method and url, while the operation method (personal_sign, eth_signTransaction) lives in the body; can an attacker swap the body operation while keeping the same signed envelope via create(): WalletCreate with optional privy-idempotency-key header?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/create.ts](src/wallet-api/create.ts) - create(): WalletCreate with optional privy-idempotency-key header, owner_id: undefined
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create in server-wallet mode
- Attacker controls: chain_type, idempotency key, repetition/concurrency
- Exploit idea: Reuse a signature across two body variants that share url and method.
- Invariant to test: Signed material must cover the semantic operation, not just the transport.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: reuse the create(): WalletCreate with optional privy-idempotency-key header signature with a modified body and assert rejection.
