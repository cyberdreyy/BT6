# Q3786: retry amplification per request in shard_endpoints.allMembers

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests make one accepted request at shard selection for a user trigger request routed to a sharded DON cause repeated node work through the retry logic near `allMembers`, multiplying DON execution per unit of entitlement?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/shard_endpoints.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/shard_endpoints.go) -> `allMembers`
- Entrypoint: shard selection for a user trigger request routed to a sharded DON
- Attacker controls: donId/shard fields in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `donId/shard fields in the request` that never reaches a terminal state.
- Invariant to test: retries must be bounded per request and counted against the caller's quota
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - rate limit violation: unpaid/unauthorized DON execution beyond the caller's entitlement
- Fast validation: test counting node messages produced by one user request
