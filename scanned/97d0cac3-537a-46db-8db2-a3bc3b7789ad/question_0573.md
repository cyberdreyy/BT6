# Q0573: expiry skew accepts a stale token in Privy.ts

## Question
tokenIsActive applies a 30 second skew over an unverified exp; can an attacker exploit clock skew or a crafted exp so Privy constructor treats an expired credential as active and skips refresh?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Set a system clock offset or craft exp and observe the refresh being skipped.
- Invariant to test: Token validity decisions must not depend on client clock or unverified claims.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: freeze Date.now past exp+skew and assert Privy constructor triggers a refresh.
