# Q1672: InMemoryCache prototype keys in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
InMemoryCache stores entries on a plain object; can an attacker supply a key such as __proto__ or constructor through PrivyInternal.fetch so a read returns an inherited value or a write corrupts the cache?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Call the storage put/get path with prototype-named keys.
- Invariant to test: Cache keys must not reach object prototype slots.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: put and get '__proto__' through PrivyInternal.fetch and assert isolation.
