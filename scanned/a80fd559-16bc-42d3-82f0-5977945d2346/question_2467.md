# Q2467: root wallet chosen by index order in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
getRootWallet returns the first ethereum wallet, else the first solana wallet; can an attacker influence linked-account ordering so toWalletApiTypedData (types delegates under a root wallet the user did not intend?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Construct a user with several embedded wallets and observe the root chosen.
- Invariant to test: Root-wallet selection must be explicit, not positional.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: build a user with multiple wallets and assert toWalletApiTypedData (types requires an explicit root selection.
