# Q2902: hex detection via loose regex in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
The hex predicate accepts any 0x-prefixed hex string of any length, including empty; can an attacker exploit that in EventCallbackQueue.enqueue so a zero-length or odd-length value is passed to the signer?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Submit '0x' and an odd-length hex string.
- Invariant to test: Hex inputs must be length-validated before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: feed '0x' and odd-length values to EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert rejection.
