# Q0811: bigint and undefined fields collapse the cache key in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
The cache key is built with JSON.stringify, which drops undefined values and functions; can an attacker craft two different payloads that produce the same key inside EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*')?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Pass payloads differing only by an undefined field and observe the shared cache entry.
- Invariant to test: Cache keys must be injective over the payloads they represent.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') produces different keys for payloads differing only in undefined-valued fields.
