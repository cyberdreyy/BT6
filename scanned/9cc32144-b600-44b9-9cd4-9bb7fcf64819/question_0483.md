# Q0483: no origin validation on inbound replies in walletRpc.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages accepts any object whose event starts with 'privy:'; can an attacker cause an inbound message from a frame the SDK never addressed to settle a pending request in handleWalletApiRpc?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Feed the SDK a message object shaped like an iframe reply from an unrelated source.
- Invariant to test: Inbound replies consumed by src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts must be provably from the wallet iframe.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a hand-built reply object to handleWalletApiRpc and assert provenance is checked.
