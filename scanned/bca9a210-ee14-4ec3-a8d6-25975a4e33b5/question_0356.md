# Q0356: switchActiveUser accepts an unauthenticated id in logger.ts

## Question
switchActiveUserId only checks membership in privy:saved-users; can an attacker make logger levels NONE/ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG switch to an id whose tokens are absent, so subsequent calls fall back to the null-keyed credentials of another account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/logger.ts](src/client/logger.ts) - logger levels NONE/ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG, privy:refresh debug lines
- Entrypoint: new Privy({logLevel: 'DEBUG'})
- Attacker controls: what the SDK writes to console at each level
- Exploit idea: Add an id to saved-users, switch to it, then call getAccessToken.
- Invariant to test: Switching users must require that user's own stored credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: switch to a saved id with no tokens and assert getAccessToken returns null instead of the previous user's token.
