# Q1307: cpi_kamino_deposit: deposit accounting mints too much internal value [replay-of-a-previously-valid] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `kamino_deposit` with replay of a previously valid CPI context against a new user account so `cpi_kamino_deposit` credits more internal value than the external integration actually received, breaking `external CPI deposit and internal marginfi accounting must be economically atomic and identically sized` and causing `Critical: phantom value, protocol loss, or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/kamino/deposit.rs` / `cpi_kamino_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `kamino_deposit`
- Attacker controls: replay of a previously valid CPI context against a new user account
- Exploit idea: Audit share conversions, fee-adjusted transfers, and rounding around CPI deposit accounting. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: external CPI deposit and internal marginfi accounting must be economically atomic and identically sized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value, protocol loss, or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Compare external protocol balances against marginfi internal balances after adversarial deposit amounts and assert no phantom value is minted. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
