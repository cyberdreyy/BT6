# Q2268: no response signature verification in update-wallet.ts

## Question
The wallet-api response is consumed after only a method-name comparison; can an attacker return a response through updateWallet(): signs {version:1 whose signature field is arbitrary and have it used or broadcast?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts](src/wallet-api/update-wallet.ts) - updateWallet(): signs {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id}, body} with NO privy-request-expiry header
- Entrypoint: session signer add/remove
- Attacker controls: the body (additional_signers) and the resulting long-lived authorization signature
- Exploit idea: Return an arbitrary signature and observe it flowing to the caller.
- Invariant to test: Responses carrying signatures must be verified against the request and the wallet key.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a bogus signature from updateWallet(): signs {version:1's route and assert verification fails.
