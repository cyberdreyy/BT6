# Q2191: total_size arithmetic overflows on reachable values (field_frames.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `total_size` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/field_frames.rs` with amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates, and make the arithmetic in `total_size` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/field_frames.rs` -> `total_size()` (around line 28)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `total_size` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `total_size` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
