# Q0774: unlink of the last identity leaves an orphan session in OAuthApi.ts

## Question
Can an attacker call OAuthApi.generateURL's unlink path to remove the only linked account that authenticated the session, then keep using the still-valid stored tokens on the now-unreachable account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts](src/client/auth/OAuthApi.ts) - OAuthApi.generateURL, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL(provider, redirectTo) then loginWithCode(code, state, provider)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to URL, returned authorization_code and state_code, provider string, concurrent flows
- Exploit idea: Unlink the sole identity, then call privy.getAccessToken() and a wallet operation with the retained credentials.
- Invariant to test: Removing the last authentication factor must invalidate the local session credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: unlink the last account then assert Session.destroyLocalState ran and getAccessToken returns null.
