# Q0608: bigint stringification changes values in ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts

## Question
handleSignTransaction converts bigint fields with toHex over Object.keys, including nested call values; can an attacker craft a field whose conversion is lossy so ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage signs a different value than displayed?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts](src/solana/ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.ts) - ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage, signTransaction, signAndSendTransaction, signAndSendAllTransactions, disconnect (account injected into every feature call)
- Entrypoint: new ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet({wallet, account}) then sign*
- Attacker controls: the inputs spread into the wallet-standard feature calls and the returned array shape
- Exploit idea: Submit values at the edges of the bigint/number/hex conversions and diff the serialised output.
- Invariant to test: Numeric conversion must be exact and total for every signed field.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: property-test numeric fields through ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet.signMessage and assert round-trip equality.
