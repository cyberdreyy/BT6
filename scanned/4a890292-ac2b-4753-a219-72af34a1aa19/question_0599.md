# Q0599: error branch forges a wallet error in resolve.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages routes any reply with an error field into reject(new PrivyIframeError(type, message)); can an attacker deliver an error reply with type 'wallet_not_on_device' so resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto starts a recovery flow?

## Target
- File/function: [src/crypto/resolve.ts](src/crypto/resolve.ts) - resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto
- Entrypoint: new Privy({crypto})
- Attacker controls: the crypto object the integrator/app passes in, and fallback behaviour when subtle is unavailable
- Exploit idea: Post an error reply with the recovery-triggering type for a pending connect.
- Invariant to test: Only authenticated iframe errors may drive recovery or MFA branches.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: deliver a forged error reply through resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto and assert no recovery is attempted.
