# Q0588: generate_vote_tx arithmetic overflows on reachable values (replay_stage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `generate_vote_tx` in `core/src/replay_stage.rs` with a path that consumes the resource before the meter is charged, and make the arithmetic in `generate_vote_tx` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/replay_stage.rs` -> `generate_vote_tx()` (around line 3190)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a path that consumes the resource before the meter is charged
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `generate_vote_tx` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `generate_vote_tx` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
