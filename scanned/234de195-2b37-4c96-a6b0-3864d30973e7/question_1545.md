# Q1545: code_verifier survives a failed exchange in pkce.ts

## Question
Does generateState leave privy:code_verifier and privy:state_code in storage when the exchange throws, so a later attacker-triggered callback can replay them?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Fail the authenticate request, then deliver a crafted callback that reuses the still-stored state/verifier pair.
- Invariant to test: PKCE material must be deleted on every terminal outcome, not only on success.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the exchange reject and assert both storage keys are absent afterwards.
