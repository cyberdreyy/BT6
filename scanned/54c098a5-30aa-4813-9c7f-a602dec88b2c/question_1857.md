# Q1857: calculate_fee_details decodes attacker data into a wrong but plausible result (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `calculate_fee_details` in `fee/src/lib.rs` with a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide, and have `calculate_fee_details` render the raw bytes as a different but plausible program, authority, amount, or decimals, so that the invariant "Parsed output faithfully represents the raw bytes, or the decoder reports 'unparsed'." breaks and the result is RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `fee/src/lib.rs` -> `calculate_fee_details()` (around line 29)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide
- Exploit idea: Author instruction/account bytes that `calculate_fee_details` renders with the wrong program, authority, amount, or decimals, misleading downstream consumers.
- Invariant to test: Parsed output faithfully represents the raw bytes, or the decoder reports 'unparsed'.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash - single low-rate call from one client crashes or stalls the node (20-65 SOL)
- Fast validation: Round-trip test: parse then re-encode; assert equality, and assert ambiguous input is reported as unparsed.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
