# Q0984: create-on-login policy evaluated client-side in getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets.ts

## Question
getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets: filter embedded + solana decides whether to provision a wallet from the createOnLogin setting and the user's existing accounts; can an attacker influence that evaluation so a wallet is created (or skipped) against the app's policy?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets.ts](src/utils/getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets.ts) - getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets: filter embedded + solana, sort by wallet_index
- Entrypoint: Solana wallet enumeration
- Attacker controls: linked_accounts contents, duplicate indices
- Exploit idea: Present linked-account sets that flip each branch.
- Invariant to test: Provisioning policy must be evaluated against server-confirmed account state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: enumerate account sets through getAllUserEmbeddedSolanaWallets: filter embedded + solana and assert branch correctness.
