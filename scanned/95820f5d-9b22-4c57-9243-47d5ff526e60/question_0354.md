# Q0354: switchActiveUser accepts an unauthenticated id in UserApi.ts

## Question
switchActiveUserId only checks membership in privy:saved-users; can an attacker make UserApi.get switch to an id whose tokens are absent, so subsequent calls fall back to the null-keyed credentials of another account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/UserApi.ts](src/client/UserApi.ts) - UserApi.get, switchActiveUser, acceptTerms
- Entrypoint: privy.user.switchActiveUser({userId})
- Attacker controls: userId string, timing against in-flight wallet operations
- Exploit idea: Add an id to saved-users, switch to it, then call getAccessToken.
- Invariant to test: Switching users must require that user's own stored credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: switch to a saved id with no tokens and assert getAccessToken returns null instead of the previous user's token.
