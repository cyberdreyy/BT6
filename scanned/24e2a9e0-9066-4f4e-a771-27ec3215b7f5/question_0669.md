# Q0669: returned user object is not re-read from session in createSiwsMessage.ts

## Question
Does createSiwsMessage({address return the user object from the authenticate response (merged by mergeUser) without re-reading the freshly stored session, letting a stale or attacker-influenced response drive the app's is_new_user and linked_accounts view?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts](src/solana/createSiwsMessage.ts) - createSiwsMessage({address, nonce, domain, uri})
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.siws flow message construction
- Attacker controls: domain, uri, address, nonce; hardcoded 'Chain ID: mainnet' and Issued At
- Exploit idea: Return an authenticate response whose user payload disagrees with the token subject and observe which value reaches the setUser callback.
- Invariant to test: The user object handed to setUser must be consistent with the subject of the token that was just stored.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the response user.id differ from the JWT sub in the same response and assert createSiwsMessage({address rejects instead of calling setUser.
