# Q0572: expiry skew accepts a stale token in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
tokenIsActive applies a 30 second skew over an unverified exp; can an attacker exploit clock skew or a crafted exp so PrivyInternal.fetch treats an expired credential as active and skips refresh?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Set a system clock offset or craft exp and observe the refresh being skipped.
- Invariant to test: Token validity decisions must not depend on client clock or unverified claims.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: freeze Date.now past exp+skew and assert PrivyInternal.fetch triggers a refresh.
