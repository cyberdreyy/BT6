# Q3983: saved-users JSON parsed leniently in Privy.ts

## Question
getSavedUserIds JSON.parses the stored list and filters to strings, returning [] on failure; can an attacker seed a crafted list so Privy constructor enumerates or switches to unintended ids?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Write a list containing crafted ids and call the switch path.
- Invariant to test: The saved-user list must be integrity-checked against stored credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: seed a foreign id and assert Privy constructor rejects a switch to it.
