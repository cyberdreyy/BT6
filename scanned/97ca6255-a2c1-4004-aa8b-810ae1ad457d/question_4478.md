# Q4478: legacy path skips new validation in handler.copiedResponses

## Question
Does the legacy message path in `copiedResponses` at the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint skip validation added on the JSON-RPC path, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests reach capability code with an under-validated request?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go) -> `copiedResponses`
- Entrypoint: the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint
- Attacker controls: signature over the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `signature over the request` through the legacy envelope.
- Invariant to test: both paths must apply identical validation
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: differential test across legacy and JSON-RPC paths
