# Q3090: logout does not await server revocation in FarcasterApi.ts

## Question
AuthApi.logout swallows the Logout request error before clearing local state; can an attacker abuse this so the refresh token stays valid server-side while the app reports a completed logout?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts) - FarcasterApi.initializeAuth, getFarcasterStatus, authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcaster.authenticate({channel_token, message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: channel_token header value, message, signature, fid, relying_party, redirect_url
- Exploit idea: Make the Logout route fail and then reuse the previously captured refresh token.
- Invariant to test: A completed logout must guarantee server-side revocation or surface the failure.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: fail the Logout route, assert FarcasterApi.initializeAuth surfaces the failure instead of resolving silently.
