# Q1406: cost_tracker::new_from_parent_limits — cost-model undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `cost_tracker::new_from_parent_limits` and construct a transaction whose CostModel-estimated cost is below its true execution cost so block limits are bypassed, so that the invariant "estimated transaction cost is an upper bound on actual consumed cost" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation (block cost divergence)?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/cost_tracker.rs` -> `new_from_parent_limits`
- Entrypoint: a transaction submitted by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: instruction mix, account count and data length in its transaction
- Exploit idea: Construct a transaction whose CostModel-estimated cost is below its true execution cost so block limits are bypassed.
- Invariant to test: estimated transaction cost is an upper bound on actual consumed cost.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation (block cost divergence) — Critical
- Fast validation: write a unit/fuzz test decoding the crafted message and assert sanitized privileges == enforced privileges.
