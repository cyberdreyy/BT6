# Q2149: options forwarded to the broadcaster in client.ts

## Question
The options argument is passed to sendRawTransaction unchecked; can an attacker set options through SolanaClient.invokeRpc that suppress preflight and hide a failing or malicious transaction?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Send skipPreflight and non-default commitment values.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast options that affect safety checks must be constrained.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert SolanaClient.invokeRpc pins preflight-relevant options.
