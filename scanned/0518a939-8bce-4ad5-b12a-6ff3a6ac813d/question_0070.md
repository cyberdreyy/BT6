# Q0070: unsigned headers appended after signing in sign-wallet-request.ts

## Question
rpc() signs an envelope containing only privy-app-id and privy-request-expiry, then spreads the caller's extraHeaders after the signature header; can an unprivileged attacker pass headers through every wallet-api signature that are transmitted but not covered by the authorization signature, or that overwrite the signature header itself?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/sign-wallet-request.ts](src/wallet-api/sign-wallet-request.ts) - SignWalletRequest signer indirection (proxy.signWithUserSigner with accessToken)
- Entrypoint: every wallet-api signature
- Attacker controls: which message string is handed to the user signer and what it commits to
- Exploit idea: Call the wallet RPC path with an extraHeaders object containing privy-authorization-signature and privy-request-expiry and inspect the outgoing request.
- Invariant to test: Every header that influences server-side authorization must be inside the signed envelope and immutable afterwards.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call SignWalletRequest signer indirection (proxy.signWithUserSigner with accessToken) with crafted extraHeaders and assert the final headers equal the signed set.
