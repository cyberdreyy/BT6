# Q3810: login race creates duplicate identity in oidc.generateState

## Question
Can concurrent requests to the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled racing inside `generateState` create two sessions or two user rows for one identity, so an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port keeps a session that the operator cannot see or revoke?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go](core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go) -> `generateState`
- Entrypoint: the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled
- Attacker controls: redirect/callback URL (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Fire concurrent `redirect/callback URL`.
- Invariant to test: session and user creation must be serialized and idempotent per identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: concurrent test asserting a single row/session results
