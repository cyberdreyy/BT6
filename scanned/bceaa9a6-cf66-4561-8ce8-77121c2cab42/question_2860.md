# Q2860: target_tick_ns_reconciled crashes the process from one request (poh_service.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `target_tick_ns_reconciled` in `poh/src/poh_service.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make `target_tick_ns_reconciled` panic, abort, or block the runtime from that single request, so that the invariant "No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response." breaks and the result is RPC DoS/Crash?

## Target
- File/function: `poh/src/poh_service.rs` -> `target_tick_ns_reconciled()` (around line 656)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Send one request whose parameters make `target_tick_ns_reconciled` panic, abort, or block the runtime, taking down the validator rather than only the RPC thread.
- Invariant to test: No single request can panic or block the process; bad parameters yield an error response.
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash - single low-rate call from one client crashes or stalls the node (20-65 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz the request parameters against `target_tick_ns_reconciled` and assert every case returns an error response and the process survives.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
