# Q3420: is_new_user drives privileged app UI in FarcasterApi.ts

## Question
FarcasterApi.initializeAuth merges is_new_user and oauth_tokens from the authenticate response into the returned user; can an attacker influence those fields to make the integrating app treat an existing account as newly created?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts) - FarcasterApi.initializeAuth, getFarcasterStatus, authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcaster.authenticate({channel_token, message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: channel_token header value, message, signature, fid, relying_party, redirect_url
- Exploit idea: Return is_new_user true for an existing account and observe the merged user object.
- Invariant to test: Merged response flags must be derived from the authenticated result, not accepted blindly.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert FarcasterApi.initializeAuth derives is_new_user from the server result for the same subject as the stored token.
