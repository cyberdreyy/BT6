# Q1465: passkey mfa options echo caller fields in RecoveryApi.ts

## Question
MfaPasskeyApi.generateAuthenticationOptions forwards the caller's input; can an attacker set relying-party or allowed-credential fields so the MFA ceremony accepts a credential they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryApi.ts) - RecoveryApi.getRecoveryKeyMaterial, auth, icloudAuth
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.getRecoveryKeyMaterial(address, chainType)
- Attacker controls: address path param, chain_type body value
- Exploit idea: Call RecoveryApi.getRecoveryKeyMaterial with crafted options and inspect the ceremony parameters returned.
- Invariant to test: MFA ceremony parameters must be derived server-side from the enrolled credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass crafted options to RecoveryApi.getRecoveryKeyMaterial and assert they are not forwarded.
