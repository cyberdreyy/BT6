# Q0489: no origin validation on inbound replies in resolve.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages accepts any object whose event starts with 'privy:'; can an attacker cause an inbound message from a frame the SDK never addressed to settle a pending request in resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto?

## Target
- File/function: [src/crypto/resolve.ts](src/crypto/resolve.ts) - resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto
- Entrypoint: new Privy({crypto})
- Attacker controls: the crypto object the integrator/app passes in, and fallback behaviour when subtle is unavailable
- Exploit idea: Feed the SDK a message object shaped like an iframe reply from an unrelated source.
- Invariant to test: Inbound replies consumed by src/crypto/resolve.ts must be provably from the wallet iframe.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a hand-built reply object to resolveCrypto: digest and randomUUID defaults from globalThis.crypto and assert provenance is checked.
