# Q3561: solana create takes an ethereum account argument in EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts

## Question
createSolana accepts an ethereumAccount whose provider is loaded first; can an attacker pass a foreign ethereum account through EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') so entropy from another wallet is used for the new Solana wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts](src/embedded/EmbeddedWalletProxy.ts) - EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*'), handleEmbeddedWalletMessages, invokeWithMfa, waitForReady, reload, ping, rpcWallet, signWithUserSigner, setRecovery, delegateWallets
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.onMessage(msg) fed from the host page's message listener
- Attacker controls: the {id, event, data, error} object handed to onMessage, its arrival order and timing
- Exploit idea: Call createSolana with an ethereum account object that is not the user's.
- Invariant to test: Cross-chain wallet derivation must use only the authenticated user's own accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign ethereum account to EmbeddedWalletProxy.invoke (postMessage target '*') and assert rejection.
