# Q2585: off-chain parser trusts the preamble in getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts

## Question
parseSolanaOffchainMessage validates the 0xFF prefix and the 'solana offchain' text but returns version, format and signer bytes unchecked; can an attacker feed bytes through getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address so the parsed signer public key differs from the actual signer?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts](src/solana/getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction.ts) - getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address
- Entrypoint: every Solana signTransaction / signAndSendTransaction call
- Attacker controls: transaction structure, versioned vs legacy, address-table lookups, duplicate/ordered keys
- Exploit idea: Parse a crafted buffer with an arbitrary signer field.
- Invariant to test: Parsed signer identity must be verified against the expected signer.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: parse a crafted buffer through getWalletPublicKeyFromTransaction: searches message.staticAccountKeys for the wallet address and assert the signer is validated.
