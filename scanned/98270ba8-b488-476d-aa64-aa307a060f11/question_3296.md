# Q3296: solana and ethereum lists share the predicate in getUserSmartWallet.ts

## Question
Both list helpers use the same embedded predicate with a chain filter; can an attacker produce an account whose chain_type is absent so it is excluded from both lists yet still signable?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getUserSmartWallet.ts](src/utils/getUserSmartWallet.ts) - getUserSmartWallet: first linked account of type smart_wallet
- Entrypoint: smart-wallet routing and linking
- Attacker controls: linked_accounts contents including multiple smart wallets
- Exploit idea: Omit chain_type on an embedded account.
- Invariant to test: Every signable account must appear in exactly one enumeration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: omit chain_type and assert getUserSmartWallet: first linked account of type smart_wallet surfaces the account or rejects it.
