# Q2575: wallet-api rpc method echo check only in session-signers.ts

## Question
walletRpc verifies the response method name equals the requested one but not the wallet or params; can an attacker return a signature produced for another payload through addSessionSigners (getWallet then updateWallet with additional_signers.concat)?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/session-signers.ts](src/embedded/stack/session-signers.ts) - addSessionSigners (getWallet then updateWallet with additional_signers.concat), removeSessionSigners
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet session-signer flows
- Attacker controls: signers array contents, concurrency against another add/remove, wallet object fields
- Exploit idea: Return a response whose method matches but whose signature is for a different message.
- Invariant to test: A signing response must be bound to the exact request that produced it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a mismatched signature from addSessionSigners (getWallet then updateWallet with additional_signers.concat)'s route and assert it is rejected.
