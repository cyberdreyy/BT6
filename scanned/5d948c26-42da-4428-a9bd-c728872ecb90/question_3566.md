# Q3566: solana create takes an ethereum account argument in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
createSolana accepts an ethereumAccount whose provider is loaded first; can an attacker pass a foreign ethereum account through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction so entropy from another wallet is used for the new Solana wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Call createSolana with an ethereum account object that is not the user's.
- Invariant to test: Cross-chain wallet derivation must use only the authenticated user's own accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign ethereum account to toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert rejection.
