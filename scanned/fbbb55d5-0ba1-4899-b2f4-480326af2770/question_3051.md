# Q3051: connections list fetched per request in CrossAppApi.ts

## Question
getCrossAppConnections is fetched on each wallet action; can an attacker cause the list to change between the resolution and the request in CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication so the token is sent to a different provider than the one authorised?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/CrossAppApi.ts](src/client/CrossAppApi.ts) - CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication, getProviderAccessToken (Token expiry only), getCrossAppConnections, providerAccessTokenStorageKey('privy:cross-app:<appId>')
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.getProviderAccessToken(appId)
- Attacker controls: the stored provider access token string and the provider app id used to key it
- Exploit idea: Change the connections response between the two awaits.
- Invariant to test: Provider identity must be pinned for the duration of an operation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Integration test: swap the connections mid-call in CrossAppApi.updateOnCrossAppAuthentication and assert abort.
