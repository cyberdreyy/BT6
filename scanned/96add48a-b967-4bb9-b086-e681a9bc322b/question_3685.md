# Q3685: Custom postInteraction can skew deployment integrator_only oversized_tail

## Question
Can a maker-authored order that uses integrator fee without protocol fee and the tail is larger than expected and contains extra garbage include a custom tail `IPostInteraction` target that reenters settlement or mutates assumptions before the source clone is checked for balances, causing `_postInteraction()` to deploy or validate the wrong escrow state?

## Target
- File/function: `contracts/BaseEscrowFactory.sol::_postInteraction`
- Entrypoint: `LimitOrderProtocol.fillOrderArgs(...)` with a custom post-interaction tail
- Attacker controls: the custom post-interaction target and calldata, the fee blob, and the chosen settlement path
- Exploit idea: Use the externally called tail before final source-balance checks to disturb the assumed state.
- Invariant to test: External custom post-interaction logic must not let the order fill complete with a different escrow state than the factory expects.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion
- Fast validation: Attach a reentering custom post-interaction target to an order using integrator fee without protocol fee and the tail is larger than expected and contains extra garbage, then inspect whether clone deployment or balance checks can be bypassed or desynchronized.
