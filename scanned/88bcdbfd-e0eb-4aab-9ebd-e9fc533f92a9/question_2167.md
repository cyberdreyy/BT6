# Q2167: payload echoed unvalidated into the response in workflow_metadata_handler.NewWorkflowMetadataHandler

## Question
Does `NewWorkflowMetadataHandler` at the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request echo attacker-supplied request fields into the user response or into a signed artifact, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests shape data another party trusts?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/workflow_metadata_handler.go) -> `NewWorkflowMetadataHandler`
- Entrypoint: the workflow metadata/authorization lookup consulted for every user trigger request
- Attacker controls: workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `workflow owner/name/tag claimed in the request` with crafted echoable fields.
- Invariant to test: responses must contain only server/DON-derived values
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: test asserting no request field is echoed into signed output
