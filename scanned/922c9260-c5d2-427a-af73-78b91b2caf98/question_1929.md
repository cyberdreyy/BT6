# Q1929: signature appended without verification in client.ts

## Question
handleSignTransaction calls transaction.addSignature with the base64 signature returned by the signer; can an attacker return a signature for a different message through SolanaClient.invokeRpc so a malformed transaction is broadcast as the user's?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Return a valid-looking signature over other bytes and observe it being attached and broadcast.
- Invariant to test: Returned signatures must be verified against the signed message and signer key.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a foreign signature to SolanaClient.invokeRpc and assert verification fails before broadcast.
