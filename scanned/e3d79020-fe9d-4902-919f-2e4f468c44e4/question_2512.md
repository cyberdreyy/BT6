# Q2512: translate_slice_mut is not deterministic across nodes (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `translate_slice_mut` in `syscalls/src/lib.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the compute units charged for the syscall disagree with the real CPU/memory work the syscall performs, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `translate_slice_mut` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `syscalls/src/lib.rs` -> `translate_slice_mut()` (around line 609)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Find input to `translate_slice_mut` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `translate_slice_mut` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `translate_slice_mut` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
