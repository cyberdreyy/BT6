# Q3217: key builder collides on crafted user ids in Error.ts

## Question
Token storage keys are built by string interpolation of the user id; can an attacker obtain or seed a user id containing ':' so keys for two users collide?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Error.ts](src/Error.ts) - PrivyApiError, PrivyClientError, MoonpayApiError, createErrorFormatter, errorIndicatesMfaCanceled
- Entrypoint: every catch path in the SDK
- Attacker controls: error.code / error.message strings returned by any reachable response
- Exploit idea: Store sessions for ids 'a' and 'a:token' style values and compare resulting keys.
- Invariant to test: Key construction in src/Error.ts must be injective over user ids.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert PrivyApiError produces distinct keys for ids that differ only by separators.
