# Q2925: signature not bound to the access token in raw-sign.ts

## Question
The envelope commits to app id and expiry but not to the session token used to authenticate; can an attacker present a signature from rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign together with a different session token?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts](src/wallet-api/raw-sign.ts) - rawSign(): same expiry-signed envelope for WalletRawSign
- Entrypoint: raw-hash signing on an extended-chains wallet
- Attacker controls: the hash/params body fields and wallet_id
- Exploit idea: Pair a captured signature with another token.
- Invariant to test: Authorization signatures must be bound to the session that produced them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: cross a captured signature with another session and assert rejection.
