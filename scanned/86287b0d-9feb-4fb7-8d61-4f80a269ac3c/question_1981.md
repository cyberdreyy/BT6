# Q1981: juplend_deposit: deposit intermediary transfer and CPI accounting diverge [cross-market-accounts-with-the] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `juplend_deposit` through `juplend_deposit` with cross-market accounts with the same interface and token program so intermediary token transfer and CPI deposit accounting diverge, breaking `Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only` and causing `Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: cross-market accounts with the same interface and token program
- Exploit idea: Look for separate phases where user funds move to an intermediary owner/vault before the external CPI settles. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position
- Fast validation: Force controlled transfer/account edges and assert internal credits only appear if the external CPI consumed the matching amount. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
