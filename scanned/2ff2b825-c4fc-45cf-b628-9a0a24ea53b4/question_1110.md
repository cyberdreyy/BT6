# Q1110: identity token stored without subject check in FarcasterApi.ts

## Question
Session.storeIdentityTokenForUser writes whatever string the response supplies; can an attacker get an identity token for a different subject stored under their own user id via FarcasterApi.initializeAuth?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts](src/client/auth/FarcasterApi.ts) - FarcasterApi.initializeAuth, getFarcasterStatus, authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.farcaster.authenticate({channel_token, message, signature, fid})
- Attacker controls: channel_token header value, message, signature, fid, relying_party, redirect_url
- Exploit idea: Return an identity_token whose sub differs from user.id in the login response and observe it being persisted and returned by privy.getIdentityToken().
- Invariant to test: Identity tokens must only be stored under the user id they assert.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: craft a response with a mismatched identity_token subject and assert FarcasterApi.initializeAuth refuses to store it.
