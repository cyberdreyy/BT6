# Q3384: funding api selects the provider by property in generate.ts

## Question
FundingApi exposes moonpay and coinbase; can an attacker cause generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain to route a funding request to a provider the app did not configure, with parameters shaped for the other?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Call each provider with the other's parameter shape.
- Invariant to test: Provider selection and parameter schema must be validated together.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: cross provider and parameter shape in generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain and assert rejection.
