# Q1743: asset id map lookup unchecked in getIsTokenUsdc.ts

## Question
toCoinbaseAssetId falls back to 'ETH' for anything that is not USDC on known chains, and the asset id map is keyed by symbol; can an attacker choose a chain/asset pair through getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]) so the on-ramp buys a different asset than the user selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getIsTokenUsdc.ts](src/utils/getIsTokenUsdc.ts) - getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]), UsdcAddressMap, SolanaUsdcAddressMap (testnet is empty string)
- Entrypoint: funding/deposit UIs deciding USDC vs native
- Attacker controls: token address string casing, chain object, cluster name
- Exploit idea: Pass an unsupported chain with asset USDC and inspect the resulting defaultAsset.
- Invariant to test: Unsupported asset/chain pairs must be rejected, never defaulted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass unsupported pairs to getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]) and assert rejection.
