# Q3646: link succeeds against the wrong active user in maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts

## Question
In multi-user mode, can an attacker switch the active user between the request and the refresh inside maybeCreateWalletOnLogin so a credential is linked to one account but reported on another?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts](src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts) - maybeCreateWalletOnLogin, shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet, shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet, mergeUser
- Entrypoint: every auth.*.login* path after token storage
- Attacker controls: opts.embedded.{ethereum,solana}.createOnLogin, pre-existing linked wallets
- Exploit idea: Call the link method and switch active user while the request is in flight.
- Invariant to test: A link operation must apply to and report on a single, unchanged user id.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch active user mid-flight and assert maybeCreateWalletOnLogin fails rather than reporting success on the new user.
