# Q1840: address comparison is exact string equality in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
Address membership is tested by === without normalisation; can an attacker submit a checksummed or padded variant through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] so the account is not found, or a different account is selected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Pass mixed-case and padded address variants.
- Invariant to test: Address comparison must be canonical.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test address forms through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction].
