# Q2492: bank::prepare_batch_for_tests — lt-hash arithmetic

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `bank::prepare_batch_for_tests` and exploit accounts_lt_hash mixing so two different account states hash equally or overflow, so that the invariant "distinct committed account states produce distinct lt-hash contributions" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank.rs` -> `prepare_batch_for_tests`
- Entrypoint: a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: account data/lamports it writes to collide hash inputs
- Exploit idea: Exploit accounts_lt_hash mixing so two different account states hash equally or overflow.
- Invariant to test: distinct committed account states produce distinct lt-hash contributions.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write a bank test committing the block on two independent banks and asserting identical bank hash / dedup behavior.
