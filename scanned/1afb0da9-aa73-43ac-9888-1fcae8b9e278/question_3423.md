# Q3423: frozen_hash is not deterministic across nodes (blockstore_meta.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `frozen_hash` in `ledger/src/blockstore_meta.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the entry contents verified during replay disagree with the entry contents used to update the bank, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `frozen_hash` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/blockstore_meta.rs` -> `frozen_hash()` (around line 455)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `frozen_hash` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `frozen_hash` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `frozen_hash` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
