# Q0740: provider token cached in localStorage in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
CrossAppApi stores the provider access token under privy:cross-app:<appId> in plain storage; can a later unprivileged user of the same profile read it and act as the victim on the provider app after crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction]?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Complete a cross-app login, then read the storage key from a fresh context.
- Invariant to test: Provider tokens must be cleared with the session and never persisted in plain storage.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], call destroyLocalState and assert the cross-app key is gone.
