# Q3474: secret identifier traversal in handler.copiedResponses

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address another namespace or owner through identifier separators/encoding in the request validated by `copiedResponses` at the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/handler.go) -> `copiedResponses`
- Entrypoint: the vault gateway methods (secrets create/update/get/list, DKG) on the public user endpoint
- Attacker controls: signature over the request (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `signature over the request` with separators, encoded delimiters or empty components.
- Invariant to test: identifier components must be validated and joined unambiguously
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: table test over identifier parsing with hostile components
