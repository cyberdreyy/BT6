# Q3347: base64 and utf8 conversions lose bytes in wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts

## Question
The encoding helpers convert signing payloads through utf8 and base64; can an attacker submit bytes that are not valid UTF-8 so toWalletApiTypedData (types signs a lossy re-encoding of the intended payload?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-typed-data.ts) - toWalletApiTypedData (types, primary_type via String(), domain, message pass-through)
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTypedData_v4', params:[address, typedData]})
- Attacker controls: the entire typed-data object, including domain.chainId/verifyingContract and primaryType
- Exploit idea: Pass a payload with lone surrogates or 0xFF bytes and compare round-tripped output.
- Invariant to test: Encoding round trips must be byte-exact for anything that gets signed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signed-payload integrity break: the bytes signed differ from the bytes the user approved (chain, domain, recipient, amount, or encoding confusion).
- Fast validation: Unit test: round-trip non-UTF-8 byte sequences through toWalletApiTypedData (types and assert byte equality.
