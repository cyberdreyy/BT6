# Q2093: nonce reuse across two logins in PhoneApi.ts

## Question
Can an attacker reuse a nonce previously issued by init()/fetchNonce for the same address to authenticate a second time from a different device or context?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts](src/client/auth/PhoneApi.ts) - PhoneApi.sendCode, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, updatePhone, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.phone.loginWithCode(phone, code)
- Attacker controls: phoneNumber string (unnormalized), code, mode, opts.embedded
- Exploit idea: Capture the nonce, complete a login, then replay message and signature.
- Invariant to test: Each issued nonce must be single-use for PhoneApi.sendCode.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: complete a login and then replay the same message/signature and assert the second attempt fails.
