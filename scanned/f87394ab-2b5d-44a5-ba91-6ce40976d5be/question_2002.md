# Q2002: appId or clientId swapped at construction in PrivyInternal.ts

## Question
Privy's constructor accepts appId, clientId, baseUrl, storage and crypto; can an attacker in the page reach PrivyInternal.fetch with substituted options so requests are signed and stored under a different app namespace?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/PrivyInternal.ts](src/client/PrivyInternal.ts) - PrivyInternal.fetch, _beforeRequest, _beforeRequestWithoutAuth, refreshSession, _refreshSession, getAccessToken, getAccessTokenInternal, getAppConfig, createAnalyticsEvent
- Entrypoint: every SDK API call
- Attacker controls: request bodies/params, retry behaviour (retries:3 on 408/409/425/5xx), app-config supplied custom_api_url, refresh dedupe cache key
- Exploit idea: Construct a second client with a different appId sharing the same storage and observe key collisions.
- Invariant to test: Storage namespacing must prevent one app id's session from being consumed by another.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run two clients with different appIds over one Storage and assert no key collisions.
