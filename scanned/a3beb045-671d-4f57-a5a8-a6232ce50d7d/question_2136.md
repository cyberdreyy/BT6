# Q2136: signer list concatenated without validation in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
addSessionSigners concatenates the caller's signers array onto the existing list with no dedupe or ownership check; can an attacker add a signer key they control through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Call the add path with an attacker-held signer entry.
- Invariant to test: Session signers must be validated and require explicit user approval.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an arbitrary signer to toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert an approval gate is enforced.
