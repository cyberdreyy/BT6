# Q976: calculate_post_fee_spl_deposit_amount: transfer-hook or mint capability probe can be bypassed by account substitution [mixed-internal-debt-amounts-and] [family-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy` with mixed internal debt amounts and external token amounts so `calculate_post_fee_spl_deposit_amount` misprobes a mint capability because of account substitution, violating `fee-adjusted token accounting in insurance and integration paths must match real token movement exactly once` and causing `High: protocol fee/insurance theft or bad-debt drift`? Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `calculate_post_fee_spl_deposit_amount`
- Entrypoint: `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy`
- Attacker controls: mixed internal debt amounts and external token amounts
- Exploit idea: Even though admin listing choices are out of scope, a public bug in capability probing or enforcement remains in scope if it affects live banks. Focus specifically on cross-family substitution between liquidity, fee, insurance, and integration utility contexts.
- Invariant to test: fee-adjusted token accounting in insurance and integration paths must match real token movement exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: protocol fee/insurance theft or bad-debt drift
- Fast validation: Supply alternate mint/account combos around a live path and assert the utility reports capabilities only for the exact bank mint in use. Cross-substitute same-interface vaults, mints, and authorities and assert no utility-backed path accepts a foreign family.
