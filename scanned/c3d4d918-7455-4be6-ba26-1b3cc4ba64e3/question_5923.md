# Q5923: bank::get_transaction_account_lock_limit — stakes cache divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `bank::get_transaction_account_lock_limit` and mutate a stake/vote account so the stakes cache diverges from account state, skewing leader schedule or rewards, so that the invariant "the stakes cache exactly reflects committed stake/vote accounts" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank.rs` -> `get_transaction_account_lock_limit`
- Entrypoint: a transaction committed to the Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: stake/vote account mutations it authorizes
- Exploit idea: Mutate a stake/vote account so the stakes cache diverges from account state, skewing leader schedule or rewards.
- Invariant to test: the stakes cache exactly reflects committed stake/vote accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write a bank test committing the block on two independent banks and asserting identical bank hash / dedup behavior.
