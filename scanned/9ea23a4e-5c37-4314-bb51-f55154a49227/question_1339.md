# Q1339: 20 second abort mid-write in keys.ts

## Question
toAbortSignalTimeout aborts requests at 20s; can an attacker time an abort so token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session completes a partial storage mutation while the server-side effect still lands?

## Target
- File/function: [src/session/keys.ts](src/session/keys.ts) - token key builders privy:<uid>:token / :pat / :refresh_token / :id-token and cookie names privy-token / privy-refresh-token / privy-id-token / privy-session
- Entrypoint: Session storage reads and writes
- Attacker controls: the user-id component of every key, multi-user vs legacy null-keyed entries
- Exploit idea: Delay the response past the abort and compare local state to server state.
- Invariant to test: An aborted request must leave local session state unchanged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort a refresh mid-flight and assert storage still matches the pre-request state.
