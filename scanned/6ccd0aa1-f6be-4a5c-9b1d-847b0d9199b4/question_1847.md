# Q1847: validation performed on a copy in log_controller.Patch

## Question
Does `Patch` at GET and PATCH /v2/log validate one representation of an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role's input while persisting or executing another (re-parsed, re-serialized, defaulted), so the executed object escapes validation?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/log_controller.go](core/web/log_controller.go) -> `Patch`
- Entrypoint: GET and PATCH /v2/log
- Attacker controls: repeated toggling of SQL logging (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `repeated toggling of SQL logging` whose two parses differ (duplicate keys, aliases, unknown fields).
- Invariant to test: the validated bytes and the executed object must be the same value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - misreporting of prices and/or data: attacker-controlled oracle job input/output reported on-chain
- Fast validation: differential test comparing validated and persisted structures
