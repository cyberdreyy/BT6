# Q1928: juplend_deposit: deposit binds the wrong reserve, obligation, or vault [remaining-accounts-that-can-swap] [net-value]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `juplend_deposit` with remaining accounts that can swap market and reserve-like contexts so `juplend_deposit` deposits into the wrong reserve/obligation/vault context, violating `Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only` and causing `Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position`? Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: remaining accounts that can swap market and reserve-like contexts
- Exploit idea: Probe CPI account binding so superficially compatible external accounts cannot redirect where user assets or derivative shares go. Focus specifically on exact net-value conservation across user transfer, intermediary state, external CPI, and internal credit.
- Invariant to test: Juplend deposit must map exact net deposited value to exact internal credit on the configured market and supply position only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom collateral credit or redirected external position
- Fast validation: Provide mixed valid-looking reserve/obligation/vault accounts and assert deposit rejects unless the canonical configured set is used. Compare user debit, external protocol credit, and internal asset increase and assert all three line up exactly.
