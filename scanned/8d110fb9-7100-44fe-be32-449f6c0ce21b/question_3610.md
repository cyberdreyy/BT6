# Q3610: order lookup by id alone in CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts

## Question
getDeposit fetches an order purely by order id; can an attacker call CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession with another user's order id and read the deposit details?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/funding/CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts](src/client/funding/CoinbaseOnRampApi.ts) - CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession, getStatus(partnerUserId)
- Entrypoint: privy.funding.coinbase.initOnRampSession(input)
- Attacker controls: the init body (addresses, assets, amount) and partnerUserId query value
- Exploit idea: Call the order read with a foreign id.
- Invariant to test: Order reads must be scoped to the authenticated user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Integration test: read a foreign order through CoinbaseOnRampApi.initOnRampSession and assert refusal.
