# Q0479: shared MfaPromises across operations in errors.ts

## Question
MfaPromises.rootPromise/submitPromise are single mutable refs shared by every operation; can an attacker start two operations so the MFA answer supplied for the low-value one satisfies the high-value one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/errors.ts](src/embedded/errors.ts) - PrivyIframeError type guards: errorIndicatesRecoveryIsNeeded, errorIndicatesMfaTimeout, errorIndicatesMfaVerificationFailed, errorIndicatesMaxMfaRetries, errorIndicatesMfaRateLimit
- Entrypoint: every embedded-wallet catch block
- Attacker controls: the {type, message} shape of any error object that reaches these guards
- Exploit idea: Start a benign operation and a signing operation, then resolve the submit promise once.
- Invariant to test: An MFA response must satisfy only the operation that requested it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Integration test: start two PrivyIframeError type guards: errorIndicatesRecoveryIsNeeded-routed operations and assert one submitted code cannot complete both.
