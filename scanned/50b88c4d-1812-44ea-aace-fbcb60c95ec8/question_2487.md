# Q2487: serialize_parameters_for_abiv0 arithmetic overflows on reachable values (serialization.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `serialize_parameters_for_abiv0` in `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` with a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance, and make the arithmetic in `serialize_parameters_for_abiv0` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/serialization.rs` -> `serialize_parameters_for_abiv0()` (around line 336)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `serialize_parameters_for_abiv0` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `serialize_parameters_for_abiv0` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. A single unprivileged JSON-RPC or pubsub request, issued once by one client, can panic, abort, or deadlock the whole validator process rather than only its RPC service.
