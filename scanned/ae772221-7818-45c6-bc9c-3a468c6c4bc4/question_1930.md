# Q1930: Price jump exploited across one receipt - amount = whole pool

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker act on both sides of a large price change inside one transaction so the mint and the burn use different prices, with `amount` equal to the entire `total_staked_balance`, breaking the invariant that one transaction prices all of its share operations consistently, and leading to direct theft of delegator NEAR from the staking pool?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/internal.rs` - `num_shares_from_staked_amount_* / staked_amount_from_num_shares_*`
- Entrypoint: every value-moving pool method routes through these four helpers
- Attacker controls: the amounts fed into the helpers and the pool state at the time
- Exploit idea: Act on both sides of a large price change inside one transaction so the mint and the burn use different prices, with `amount` equal to the entire `total_staked_balance`.
- Invariant to test: One transaction prices all of its share operations consistently.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of delegator NEAR from the staking pool.
- Fast validation: Sim a batched mint+burn across a reward.
