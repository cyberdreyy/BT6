# Q3875: events reveal credential lifecycle in AppApi.ts

## Question
Session emits token_stored, refresh_token_stored, oauth_tokens_granted with payloads; can an attacker attach a listener through app-reachable API and learn credential state changes or the tokens themselves?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/AppApi.ts](src/client/AppApi.ts) - AppApi.getConfig, getSmartWalletConfig, appId (memoised _smartWalletConfig)
- Entrypoint: privy.app.getConfig()
- Attacker controls: app-config fields consumed as trusted (embedded_wallet_config.mode, require_user_password_on_create, custom_api_url)
- Exploit idea: Register listeners and inspect the emitted payloads during AppApi.getConfig.
- Invariant to test: Session events from src/client/AppApi.ts must not carry credential material.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: capture every event payload during AppApi.getConfig and assert none contains a token string.
