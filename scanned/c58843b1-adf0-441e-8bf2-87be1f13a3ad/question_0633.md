# Q0633: should_mark_soft_dead is not deterministic across nodes (dead_slots.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `should_mark_soft_dead` in `core/src/replay_stage/dead_slots.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the cost the block accounts for a transaction disagree with the cost replay recomputes for the same transaction, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `should_mark_soft_dead` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/replay_stage/dead_slots.rs` -> `should_mark_soft_dead()` (around line 144)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `should_mark_soft_dead` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `should_mark_soft_dead` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `should_mark_soft_dead` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged RPC or pubsub request can mutate bank, blockstore, cache, or fork-choice state that consensus later depends on, or make the node treat an unrooted slot as rooted.
