# Q0263: singleton queue shared across Privy clients in walletRpc.ts

## Question
The callback queue is a module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; can an attacker in a multi-client or multi-user page make one client's reply settle another client's pending request via handleWalletApiRpc?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletRpc.ts) - handleWalletApiRpc, handleEthereumRpc, handleSolanaRpc (method-name echo checks like i.method !== 'personal_sign')
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method, params}) on a TEE (privy-v2) wallet
- Attacker controls: method string, params array contents, response method/data fields
- Exploit idea: Instantiate two clients, start an operation on each, and deliver one reply.
- Invariant to test: Callback state must be scoped per client instance.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: create two proxies, enqueue on both through handleWalletApiRpc and assert their callback maps are disjoint.
