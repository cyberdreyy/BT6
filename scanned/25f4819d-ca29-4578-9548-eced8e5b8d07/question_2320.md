# Q2320: in-flight request map keyed without sender in message_util.ValidatedMessageFromResp

## Question
Is the in-flight request map used by `ValidatedMessageFromResp` at validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses keyed without the authenticated sender, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests evict, complete or read another user's entry?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/message_util.go) -> `ValidatedMessageFromResp`
- Entrypoint: validated conversion between gateway messages, requests and responses
- Attacker controls: encoding variants of identifiers (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `encoding variants of identifiers` colliding with the victim's key.
- Invariant to test: in-flight state must be namespaced by verified sender
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: test asserting cross-sender key isolation
