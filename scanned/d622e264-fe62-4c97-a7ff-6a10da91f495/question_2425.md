# Q2425: challenge not bound to the stored options in pkce.ts

## Question
Does generateState accept a challenge argument supplied by the caller rather than the one returned by the matching options call, enabling replay of a previously captured assertion?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Call the options method, discard the challenge, and log in with an older challenge plus its captured assertion.
- Invariant to test: The challenge submitted must be the one issued for this ceremony.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a stale challenge to generateState and assert it is rejected.
