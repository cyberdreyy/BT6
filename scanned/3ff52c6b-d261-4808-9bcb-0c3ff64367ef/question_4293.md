# Q4293: method routing selects a weaker handler in aggregator.signedResponseRequestIDEnabled

## Question
Can any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests name a method at aggregation and signature/quorum validation of vault node responses before they reach the requesting user that `signedResponseRequestIDEnabled` routes to a handler with weaker authorization while the payload targets a privileged capability?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/aggregator.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/vault/aggregator.go) -> `signedResponseRequestIDEnabled`
- Entrypoint: aggregation and signature/quorum validation of vault node responses before they reach the requesting user
- Attacker controls: the request fields that derive the signed request id (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `request fields that derive the signed request id` with a mismatched method/payload pair.
- Invariant to test: method routing and payload authorization must be consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: matrix test over method/payload mismatches
