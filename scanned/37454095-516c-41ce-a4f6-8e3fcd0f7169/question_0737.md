# Q0737: provider token cached in localStorage in throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts

## Question
CrossAppApi stores the provider access token under privy:cross-app:<appId> in plain storage; can a later unprivileged user of the same profile read it and act as the victim on the provider app after throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/utils/throwIfNotLoggedIn.ts) - throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller
- Entrypoint: every crossApp.wallet action
- Attacker controls: the user object supplied by the caller rather than read from session
- Exploit idea: Complete a cross-app login, then read the storage key from a fresh context.
- Invariant to test: Provider tokens must be cleared with the session and never persisted in plain storage.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Unit test: run throwIfNotLoggedIn(user): only checks the user object passed by the caller, call destroyLocalState and assert the cross-app key is gone.
