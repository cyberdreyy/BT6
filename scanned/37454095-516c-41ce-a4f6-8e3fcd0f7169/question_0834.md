# Q0834: expiry chosen by the client clock in rpc.ts

## Question
The expiry is derived from the local clock; can an attacker skew the clock so rpc(): builds {version:1 mints an envelope valid far into the future?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Advance the system clock and inspect the generated expiry.
- Invariant to test: Request validity must not be extendable by the client.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: mock Date.now far ahead and assert rpc(): builds {version:1 clamps the expiry.
