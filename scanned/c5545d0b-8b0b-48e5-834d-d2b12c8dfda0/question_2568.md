# Q2568: recovery timeout window is 120 seconds in index.ts

## Question
The user-owned recovery path resolves on a 120000ms timer with onRecovered; can an attacker call onRecovered without completing recovery so throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath proceeds as if the wallet were restored?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/utils/index.ts](src/embedded/utils/index.ts) - throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath, getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.setRecovery({wallet, recoveryMethod, ...})
- Attacker controls: currentRecoveryMethod vs upgradeToRecoveryMethod pair, chain rpcUrls config
- Exploit idea: Invoke the onRecovered callback from app-reachable code and observe the operation continuing.
- Invariant to test: Recovery completion must be proven by the iframe, not by a callback invocation.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: invoke onRecovered without a real recovery and assert throwIfInvalidRecoveryUpgradePath still fails.
