# Q1370: profiling endpoint yields key material in keys_controller.Index

## Question
Can an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role obtain a heap/goroutine profile through `Index` at /v2/keys/:keyType Index/Export/Import/Delete routes containing in-memory private keys, passwords or session tokens?

## Target
- File/function: [core/web/keys_controller.go](core/web/keys_controller.go) -> `Index`
- Entrypoint: /v2/keys/:keyType Index/Export/Import/Delete routes
- Attacker controls: the imported key JSON and its password (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Request `imported key JSON and its password` against the profiling handler and scan the dump.
- Invariant to test: profiling endpoints must be admin-only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: test fetching a profile from a low-role session and asserting 403
