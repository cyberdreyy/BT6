# Q3894: ping doubles as a liveness oracle in walletCreate.ts

## Question
ping() invokes privy:iframe:ready with a caller-controlled timeout; can an attacker use createWalletApiWallet to keep the ready state true while the iframe is actually serving a different session?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts) - createWalletApiWallet, create (privy-idempotency-key header)
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({idempotencyKey}) in user-controlled-server-wallets-only mode
- Attacker controls: idempotencyKey string, chainType, repeated concurrent creates
- Exploit idea: Flip the iframe session and observe the cached ready flag.
- Invariant to test: Readiness must be invalidated when the underlying wallet session changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: change the session and assert createWalletApiWallet re-verifies readiness.
