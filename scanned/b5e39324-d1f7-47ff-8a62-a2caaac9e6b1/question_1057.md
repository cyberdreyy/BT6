# Q1057: maybe_take_bank_mint: vault PDA helper and transfer path disagree on the canonical vault [remaining-accounts-with-multiple-plausible] [amount-domain]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit remaining accounts with multiple plausible mints for the same token interface so `maybe_take_bank_mint` and a downstream transfer path disagree on the canonical vault address, violating `mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts` and causing `High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss`? Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/utils/general.rs` / `maybe_take_bank_mint`
- Entrypoint: `lending_pool_handle_bankruptcy`
- Attacker controls: remaining accounts with multiple plausible mints for the same token interface
- Exploit idea: A mismatch between utility derivation and runtime constraints can redirect value even if each piece seems locally correct. Focus specifically on internal amount domain vs external token amount domain reconciliation.
- Invariant to test: mint selection for live value-moving paths must bind to the exact bank and cannot be redirected by caller-supplied remaining accounts
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: wrong mint context causing fee drift, misrouting, or protocol loss
- Fast validation: Cross-check helper output against every consuming instruction and assert only one canonical vault/address is ever accepted. Fuzz one-unit and boundary values and assert debited, credited, and accounted amounts all reconcile exactly.
