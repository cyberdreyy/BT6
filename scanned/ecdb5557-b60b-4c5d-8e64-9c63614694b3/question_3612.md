# Q3612: order lookup by id alone in moonpay.ts

## Question
getDeposit fetches an order purely by order id; can an attacker call isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay with another user's order id and read the deposit details?

## Target
- File/function: [src/funding/moonpay.ts](src/funding/moonpay.ts) - isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay, chainToMoonpayCurrency (defaults to ETH_ETHEREUM on unknown chain), fundingMethodToMoonpayPaymentMethod
- Entrypoint: MoonPay funding parameter construction
- Attacker controls: chainId and asset arguments
- Exploit idea: Call the order read with a foreign id.
- Invariant to test: Order reads must be scoped to the authenticated user.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - retrieval of sensitive user data: session/identity/provider tokens, key-material handles, or entropy identifiers reach a party that must not hold them.
- Fast validation: Integration test: read a foreign order through isSupportedChainIdForMoonpay and assert refusal.
