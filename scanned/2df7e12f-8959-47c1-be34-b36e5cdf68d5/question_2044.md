# Q2044: wallet_id accepted from the caller in rpc.ts

## Question
getWallet/updateWallet/rawSign take wallet_id from the caller; can an attacker pass a wallet id that is not theirs through rpc(): builds {version:1 and have the SDK build and sign an envelope for it?

## Target
- File/function: [src/wallet-api/rpc.ts](src/wallet-api/rpc.ts) - rpc(): builds {version:1, url, method, headers:{privy-app-id, privy-request-expiry}, body}, signs it, then spreads caller headers after the signature header
- Entrypoint: provider.request(...) on a privy-v2 wallet -> walletRpc -> rpc()
- Attacker controls: the request body (chain_type, method, wallet_id, params) and the extraHeaders object
- Exploit idea: Call the operation with a foreign wallet id.
- Invariant to test: Wallet ids must be validated against the authenticated user's linked accounts before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign wallet id to rpc(): builds {version:1 and assert refusal before signing.
