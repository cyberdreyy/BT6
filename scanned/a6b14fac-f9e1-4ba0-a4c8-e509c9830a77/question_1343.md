# Q1343: 20 second abort mid-write in Privy.ts

## Question
toAbortSignalTimeout aborts requests at 20s; can an attacker time an abort so Privy constructor completes a partial storage mutation while the server-side effect still lands?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Delay the response past the abort and compare local state to server state.
- Invariant to test: An aborted request must leave local session state unchanged.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: abort a refresh mid-flight and assert storage still matches the pre-request state.
