# Q0788: session_update_action drives local state in Token.ts

## Question
_refreshSession applies set/clear/ignore purely from the response's session_update_action; can an attacker influence that field's handling so tokens are stored under the current user without confirming the subject?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Return a refresh response with 'set' and a user id different from the active one.
- Invariant to test: Applying a refresh result must verify the returned user matches the session being refreshed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a refresh payload for a different user and assert Token.parse refuses to store it.
