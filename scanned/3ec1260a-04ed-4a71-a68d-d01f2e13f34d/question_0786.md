# Q0786: unlink of the last identity leaves an orphan session in maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts

## Question
Can an attacker call maybeCreateWalletOnLogin's unlink path to remove the only linked account that authenticated the session, then keep using the still-valid stored tokens on the now-unreachable account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts](src/client/auth/maybeCreateWalletOnLogin.ts) - maybeCreateWalletOnLogin, shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet, shouldCreateEmbeddedSolWallet, mergeUser
- Entrypoint: every auth.*.login* path after token storage
- Attacker controls: opts.embedded.{ethereum,solana}.createOnLogin, pre-existing linked wallets
- Exploit idea: Unlink the sole identity, then call privy.getAccessToken() and a wallet operation with the retained credentials.
- Invariant to test: Removing the last authentication factor must invalidate the local session credentials.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: unlink the last account then assert Session.destroyLocalState ran and getAccessToken returns null.
