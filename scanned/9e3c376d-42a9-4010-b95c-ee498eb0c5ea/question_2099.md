# Q2099: cpi_juplend_deposit: deposit intermediary transfer and CPI accounting diverge [same-slot-rate-update-against] [owner-binding]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `cpi_juplend_deposit` through `juplend_deposit` with same-slot rate update against one market and deposit into another so intermediary token transfer and CPI deposit accounting diverge, breaking `Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly` and causing `Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection`? Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/juplend/deposit.rs` / `cpi_juplend_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `juplend_deposit`
- Attacker controls: same-slot rate update against one market and deposit into another
- Exploit idea: Look for separate phases where user funds move to an intermediary owner/vault before the external CPI settles. Focus specifically on whether the resulting external position and any future rewards bind to the canonical owner only.
- Invariant to test: Juplend CPI deposit and internal accounting must remain atomic and conserve value exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom value or user fund redirection
- Fast validation: Force controlled transfer/account edges and assert internal credits only appear if the external CPI consumed the matching amount. Deposit under mixed owner and position contexts and assert every resulting derivative or reward path still belongs to the canonical owner.
