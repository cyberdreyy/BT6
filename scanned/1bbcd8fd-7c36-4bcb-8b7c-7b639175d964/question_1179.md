# Q1179: oauth token listener catches foreign grants in signTypedData.ts

## Question
linkWithCrossAppAuth attaches an addOAuthTokensListener that writes any emitted oauth_tokens to the cross-app cache for providerAppId; can an attacker trigger an unrelated OAuth grant while that listener is attached so a foreign token is cached under this provider?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signTypedData.ts) - crossApp signTypedData: params [address, generateDomainType(typedData)]
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signTypedData({user, typedData, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the whole typedData object including domain and types
- Exploit idea: Start a cross-app link, then complete an unrelated OAuth flow before the unsubscribe.
- Invariant to test: Emitted provider tokens must be routed only to the flow that requested them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Integration test: emit an unrelated grant during crossApp signTypedData: params [address and assert it is not cached.
