# Q3302: group-to-role mapping too permissive in sync.Work

## Question
Does the group-to-role mapping performed by `Work` at any authenticated /v2 request after LDAP group membership is revoked grant an elevated role on a partial, case-insensitive or substring match, letting an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role in a low-privilege group obtain admin?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/ldapauth/sync.go](core/sessions/ldapauth/sync.go) -> `Work`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated /v2 request after LDAP group membership is revoked
- Attacker controls: session id and API tokens created before revocation (attacker capability: an authenticated node user holding only the 'view' role; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Authenticate with `session id and API tokens created before revocation` from a group whose name embeds the privileged group name.
- Invariant to test: group mapping must be an exact match against the configured DN/claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - node takeover: an unauthenticated or low-role attacker gains admin control of the node, enabling key export and unauthorized transaction submission
- Fast validation: table test mapping crafted group names to roles
