# Q0992: concurrent login writes interleave active-user pointer in EmailApi.ts

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker race two privy.auth.email.loginWithCode(email, code) calls so storeActiveUserId writes user B while the later-resolving login stores user A's tokens under the null key, making privy:active-user point at the wrong credentials?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/EmailApi.ts](src/client/auth/EmailApi.ts) - EmailApi.sendCode, loginWithCode, linkWithCode, updateEmail, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.email.loginWithCode(email, code)
- Attacker controls: email string, code string, mode, opts.embedded, call ordering/repetition
- Exploit idea: Fire both logins, delay one response, then read getActiveUserId and getCustomerAccessToken.
- Invariant to test: privy:active-user and the null-keyed token copy must always describe the same subject.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: interleave two EmailApi.sendCode promises with controlled resolution order and assert Token.parse(getCustomerAccessToken()).subject === getActiveUserId().
