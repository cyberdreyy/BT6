# Q3543: refresh failure destroys local state in Privy.ts

## Question
On MISSING_OR_INVALID_TOKEN, _refreshSession calls destroyLocalState; can an attacker force that error to arrive during Privy constructor so a legitimate session is dropped and re-authentication is redirected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/Privy.ts](src/client/Privy.ts) - Privy constructor, initialize, getAccessToken, getIdentityToken, setMessagePoster, fetchPrivyRoute, getCompiledPath, track
- Entrypoint: new Privy({appId, clientId, sessions, storage, ...}) and privy.fetchPrivyRoute(...)
- Attacker controls: constructor options, arbitrary route+body via fetchPrivyRoute, message poster injection
- Exploit idea: Return the error code from the refresh route while the user is mid-flow.
- Invariant to test: Session destruction must follow an authenticated signal, not any error carrying that code.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return the error from an unauthenticated response and assert Privy constructor does not clear stored tokens.
