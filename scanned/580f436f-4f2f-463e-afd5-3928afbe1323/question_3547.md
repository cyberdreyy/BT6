# Q3547: refresh failure destroys local state in Error.ts

## Question
On MISSING_OR_INVALID_TOKEN, _refreshSession calls destroyLocalState; can an attacker force that error to arrive during PrivyApiError so a legitimate session is dropped and re-authentication is redirected?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Error.ts](src/Error.ts) - PrivyApiError, PrivyClientError, MoonpayApiError, createErrorFormatter, errorIndicatesMfaCanceled
- Entrypoint: every catch path in the SDK
- Attacker controls: error.code / error.message strings returned by any reachable response
- Exploit idea: Return the error code from the refresh route while the user is mid-flow.
- Invariant to test: Session destruction must follow an authenticated signal, not any error carrying that code.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return the error from an unauthenticated response and assert PrivyApiError does not clear stored tokens.
