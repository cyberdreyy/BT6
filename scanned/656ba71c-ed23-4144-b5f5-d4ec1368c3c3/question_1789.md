# Q1789: signature verified against the wrong domain in multihandler.NewMultiHandler

## Question
Does `NewMultiHandler` at gateway method routing (HandleLegacyUserMessage/HandleJSONRPCUserMessage) for user requests verify signatures without a domain separator/method tag, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests reuse a signature obtained in a different context as gateway authorization?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/multihandler.go](core/services/gateway/multihandler.go) -> `NewMultiHandler`
- Entrypoint: gateway method routing (HandleLegacyUserMessage/HandleJSONRPCUserMessage) for user requests
- Attacker controls: donId selection (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Reuse `donId selection` produced for another purpose.
- Invariant to test: signed payloads must be domain-separated per purpose
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: test reusing a foreign-domain signature
