# Q0313: caip2 prefix matching is loose in getIsTokenUsdc.ts

## Question
caip2ToChainType matches on 'eip155:', 'solana:', 'bip122:' and 'tron:' prefixes only; can an attacker pass a caip2 string through getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]) whose prefix matches one chain family while the numeric reference points at another chain?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/getIsTokenUsdc.ts](src/utils/getIsTokenUsdc.ts) - getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]), UsdcAddressMap, SolanaUsdcAddressMap (testnet is empty string)
- Entrypoint: funding/deposit UIs deciding USDC vs native
- Attacker controls: token address string casing, chain object, cluster name
- Exploit idea: Pass 'eip155:999999' and observe the chain type and address chosen.
- Invariant to test: Chain identity must be resolved from the full caip2 reference, not the prefix.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: table-test caip2 strings through getIsTokenUsdc (exact match against UsdcAddressMap[chain.id]) and assert full-reference validation.
