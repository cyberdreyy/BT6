# Q1724: transaction_execution::check_block_cost_limits — rent-collection divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `transaction_execution::check_block_cost_limits` and craft an account whose rent/rent-exempt handling differs between rent_calculator and commit across validators, so that the invariant "rent collection and rent-exempt checks are deterministic and value-exact" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/transaction_execution.rs` -> `check_block_cost_limits`
- Entrypoint: a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the lamports and data size of an account it funds near the rent threshold
- Exploit idea: Craft an account whose rent/rent-exempt handling differs between rent_calculator and commit across validators.
- Invariant to test: rent collection and rent-exempt checks are deterministic and value-exact.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write an SVM/bank test running the transaction twice and asserting deterministic, exact fee/rollback/rent accounting.
