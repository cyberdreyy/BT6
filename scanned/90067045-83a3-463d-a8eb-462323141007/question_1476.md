# Q1476: entropyId is just the wallet address in wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts

## Question
getEntropyDetailsFromAccount uses the account address as the entropyId; can an attacker pass an address they merely know through toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and cause the iframe to load or recover the wrong wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts](src/embedded/stack/wallet-api-eth-transaction.ts) - toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction, toQuantity, toTransactionType (allowed types 0,1,2,4), toAccessList, toFeePayerSignature, toData
- Entrypoint: provider.request({method:'eth_signTransaction', params:[tx]})
- Attacker controls: every transaction field: to, value, data, nonce, chainId, gas, type, accessList, calls, feeToken
- Exploit idea: Call the provider path with a foreign address as entropyId.
- Invariant to test: Entropy identifiers must be validated against the authenticated user's own accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a foreign address into toWalletApiUnsignedEthTransaction and assert it is rejected before the proxy call.
