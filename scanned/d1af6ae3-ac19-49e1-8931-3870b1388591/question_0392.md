# Q0392: broadcast through a caller-influenced RPC in smart-wallets.ts

## Question
handleSendTransaction broadcasts with eth_sendRawTransaction through the viem client built by getJsonRpcEndpointFromChain, which prefers rpcUrls.privyWalletOverride then the supportedChains config; can an attacker supply a chain entry through import {...} from '@privy-io/js-sdk-core/smart-wallets' so the signed transaction is sent to an endpoint they control?

## Target
- File/function: [src/smart-wallets.ts](src/smart-wallets.ts) - smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY, COINBASE_SMART_WALLET, KERNEL, LIGHT_ACCOUNT, SAFE, THIRDWEB, NEXUS)
- Entrypoint: import {...} from '@privy-io/js-sdk-core/smart-wallets'
- Attacker controls: smart wallet type/version strings used for linking and routing
- Exploit idea: Construct the client with a supportedChains entry carrying an override RPC and observe the broadcast target.
- Invariant to test: Broadcast endpoints must come from a trusted, pinned configuration.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass a chain with a crafted override to smart-wallets entry (BICONOMY and assert the broadcast target is the trusted endpoint.
