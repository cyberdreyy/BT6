# Q3214: key builder collides on crafted user ids in UserApi.ts

## Question
Token storage keys are built by string interpolation of the user id; can an attacker obtain or seed a user id containing ':' so keys for two users collide?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/UserApi.ts](src/client/UserApi.ts) - UserApi.get, switchActiveUser, acceptTerms
- Entrypoint: privy.user.switchActiveUser({userId})
- Attacker controls: userId string, timing against in-flight wallet operations
- Exploit idea: Store sessions for ids 'a' and 'a:token' style values and compare resulting keys.
- Invariant to test: Key construction in src/client/UserApi.ts must be injective over user ids.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert UserApi.get produces distinct keys for ids that differ only by separators.
