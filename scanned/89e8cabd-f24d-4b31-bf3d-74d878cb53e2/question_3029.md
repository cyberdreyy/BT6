# Q3029: wallet-standard features called with an injected account in client.ts

## Question
ConnectedStandardSolanaWallet spreads `{...input, account: this.#t}` into every feature call; can an attacker construct the wrapper with an account that does not match the underlying wallet so SolanaClient.invokeRpc requests signatures for a foreign account?

## Target
- File/function: [src/solana/client.ts](src/solana/client.ts) - SolanaClient.invokeRpc, getBalance, getTokenAccountsByOwner, getAccountInfo (cluster.rpcUrl, errors swallowed to null)
- Entrypoint: new SolanaClient(cluster) balance/token reads used by funding UIs
- Attacker controls: cluster.rpcUrl value, RPC response shape, null-on-error results consumed as truth
- Exploit idea: Construct the wrapper with a mismatched account/wallet pair.
- Invariant to test: The wrapped account must be verified to belong to the wrapped wallet.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: construct SolanaClient.invokeRpc with a mismatched pair and assert construction fails.
