# Q0300: response type checked but payload trusted in sendTransaction.ts

## Question
sendCrossAppRequest validates privy_cross_app_type equals PRIVY_CROSS_APP_ACTION_RESPONSE and then returns privy_cross_app_payload verbatim; can an attacker return a payload through crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] that the app treats as a signature or transaction hash without any verification?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/sendTransaction.ts) - crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction], method privy_sendSmartWalletTx or eth_sendTransaction
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.sendTransaction({user, transaction, address, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: the transaction object (to, value, data, chainId) and the returned transactionHash
- Exploit idea: Return a well-formed response with an arbitrary payload string.
- Invariant to test: A returned signature or hash must be verified against the request before being surfaced.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return an arbitrary payload from crossApp sendTransaction: params [transaction] and assert verification before it is returned.
