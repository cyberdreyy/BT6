# Q2205: relying party string controlled by caller in pkce.ts

## Question
In src/pkce.ts, is the relying party supplied by the caller and echoed into the ceremony, letting an attacker start a credential ceremony scoped to a different origin than the one they occupy?

## Target
- File/function: [src/pkce.ts](src/pkce.ts) - generateState, generateCodeVerifier, generateCodeChallenge (S256), privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier storage keys
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.oauth.generateURL() -> storage puts
- Attacker controls: interleaving of flows that share the two global storage keys, method downgrade to plain
- Exploit idea: Call generateState with a relying party that is not the current origin and observe the options returned.
- Invariant to test: The relying party used by generateState must be derived from the app's configured origin.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call generateState with a foreign relying party and assert the SDK refuses.
