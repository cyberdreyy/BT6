# Q1591: session cookie attributes in oidc.NewOIDCAuthenticator

## Question
Are the cookie attributes set around `NewOIDCAuthenticator` at the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled weak enough (missing Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite, overly broad Path or Domain) that an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port can obtain or ride an operator session and then export keys?

## Target
- File/function: [core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go](core/sessions/oidcauth/oidc.go) -> `NewOIDCAuthenticator`
- Entrypoint: the OIDC sign-in and token-exchange HTTP endpoints exposed when OIDC auth is enabled
- Attacker controls: state and code parameters (attacker capability: an unauthenticated HTTP client that can reach the node API port; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Observe the Set-Cookie produced for `state and code parameters` and exercise the weakest attribute.
- Invariant to test: session cookies must be HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite-restricted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential/key theft: node blockchain private keys, key export bundles or node secrets retrieved from a running node
- Fast validation: handler test asserting the Set-Cookie attribute set
