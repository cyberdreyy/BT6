# Q1097: external wallets suppress creation in shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts

## Question
shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user treats any linked external wallet of the chain as a reason to skip creation unless the mode is all-users; can an attacker link a wallet they control so the victim's embedded wallet is never created and the app falls back to the attacker's?

## Target
- File/function: [src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts](src/utils/shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet.ts) - shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user, createOnLogin: 'off'|'users-without-wallets'|'all-users')
- Entrypoint: maybeCreateWalletOnLogin after every login
- Attacker controls: external wallets linked to the account and the createOnLogin setting
- Exploit idea: Link an external wallet then log in with users-without-wallets.
- Invariant to test: Provisioning decisions must not be steerable by linking an unrelated wallet.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: link an external wallet and assert shouldCreateEmbeddedEthWallet(user still provisions per policy.
