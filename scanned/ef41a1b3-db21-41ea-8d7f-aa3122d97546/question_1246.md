# Q1246: init and submit enrollment not bound in RecoveryOAuthApi.ts

## Question
initEnrollMfa and submitEnrollMfa are separate calls with no client-side correlation; can an attacker interleave two enrollments so the code from one is submitted against the other?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts](src/client/recovery/RecoveryOAuthApi.ts) - RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL, authorize (shares privy:state_code / privy:code_verifier with login OAuth)
- Entrypoint: privy.recovery.auth.generateURL(redirectTo) then authorize(code, state)
- Attacker controls: redirect_to, returned code/state, interleaving with privy.auth.oauth flows
- Exploit idea: Start two enrollments and cross the submissions.
- Invariant to test: Enrollment submissions must be bound to the initialization that produced them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - authorization bypass: a privileged wallet or MFA operation completes without the user-approval gate the app relies on.
- Fast validation: Integration test: cross two enrollment flows through RecoveryOAuthApi.generateURL and assert the mismatch is rejected.
