# Q0592: error branch forges a wallet error in EventCallbackQueue.ts

## Question
handleEmbeddedWalletMessages routes any reply with an error field into reject(new PrivyIframeError(type, message)); can an attacker deliver an error reply with type 'wallet_not_on_device' so EventCallbackQueue.enqueue starts a recovery flow?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts](src/embedded/EventCallbackQueue.ts) - EventCallbackQueue.enqueue, dequeue (id-only lookup then event-name switch), flush; module-level singleton shared by every proxy instance; ids from a global 'id-N' counter
- Entrypoint: any embedded wallet operation that awaits an iframe reply
- Attacker controls: reply id values, reply event names, arrival ordering, reload/flush timing
- Exploit idea: Post an error reply with the recovery-triggering type for a pending connect.
- Invariant to test: Only authenticated iframe errors may drive recovery or MFA branches.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: deliver a forged error reply through EventCallbackQueue.enqueue and assert no recovery is attempted.
