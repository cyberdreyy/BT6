# Q1668: InMemoryCache prototype keys in Token.ts

## Question
InMemoryCache stores entries on a plain object; can an attacker supply a key such as __proto__ or constructor through Token.parse so a read returns an inherited value or a write corrupts the cache?

## Target
- File/function: [src/Token.ts](src/Token.ts) - Token.parse, Token.subject/expiration/issuer/audience, isExpired (jose.decodeJwt, no signature verification)
- Entrypoint: Session.getCustomerAccessToken, backfillLegacySession, CrossAppApi.getProviderAccessToken
- Attacker controls: any JWT-shaped string reachable into storage or a cross-app response
- Exploit idea: Call the storage put/get path with prototype-named keys.
- Invariant to test: Cache keys must not reach object prototype slots.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: put and get '__proto__' through Token.parse and assert isolation.
