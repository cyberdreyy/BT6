# Q2985: error path leaves tokens but no user in SmartWalletApi.ts

## Question
When the post-login wallet creation step throws, does SmartWalletApi.init leave the freshly stored tokens in place while never invoking setUser, leaving a live session the app believes does not exist?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts](src/client/auth/SmartWalletApi.ts) - SmartWalletApi.init, link, generateSmartWalletSiweMessage
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.smartWallet.init(wallet) then link(message, signature, type, version)
- Attacker controls: message override, signature, smart_wallet_type, smart_wallet_version, chainId
- Exploit idea: Force maybeCreateWalletOnLogin to reject and inspect storage and the app callback.
- Invariant to test: A login that does not complete must not leave usable credentials behind.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: make the create step reject and assert storage holds no privy:token afterwards.
