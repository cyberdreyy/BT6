# Q2709: length/format validation gap in callback.Wait

## Question
Does the field validation in `Wait` at the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user accept an over-long, truncated or non-hex identifier that later code slices or parses unchecked, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests address a different workflow?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/common/callback.go) -> `Wait`
- Entrypoint: the callback used to return a DON response to the originating gateway user
- Attacker controls: timing of late responses (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `timing of late responses` at and beyond the documented length bounds.
- Invariant to test: every identifier must be length- and charset-validated before use
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: table test at length boundaries for each identifier field
