# Q4092: challenge reuse or predictability in multihandler.HandleJSONRPCUserMessage

## Question
Is the challenge produced/validated by `HandleJSONRPCUserMessage` at gateway method routing (HandleLegacyUserMessage/HandleJSONRPCUserMessage) for user requests predictable, reusable or unbound to the connection, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests replay a captured handshake response?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/multihandler.go](core/services/gateway/multihandler.go) -> `HandleJSONRPCUserMessage`
- Entrypoint: gateway method routing (HandleLegacyUserMessage/HandleJSONRPCUserMessage) for user requests
- Attacker controls: the requested method name (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Replay `requested method name` captured from another handshake.
- Invariant to test: challenges must be random, single-use and connection-bound
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of protocol revenue: DON work charged to another owner/subscriber than the attacker
- Fast validation: test replaying a handshake response
