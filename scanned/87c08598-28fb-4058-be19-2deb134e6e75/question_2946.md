# Q2946: usdc map missing for a supported chain in polling.ts

## Question
UsdcAddressMap covers a fixed chain set; can an attacker select a chain through getDeposit where the lookup is undefined so every token compares false and the flow proceeds with the wrong asset assumption?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts](src/action/depositAddress/polling.ts) - getDeposit, waitForDeposit (GetNextDepositAddressOrder with after=quoteCreatedAt), waitForCompletion (until status !== 'executing'), 2000ms interval / 1800000ms timeout
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.waitForDeposit({...})
- Attacker controls: depositAddressId, orderId, quoteCreatedAt, pollIntervalMs, timeoutMs, abort signal
- Exploit idea: Pass a chain absent from the map.
- Invariant to test: Unknown chains must abort the asset decision.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: pass an unmapped chain to getDeposit and assert an explicit error.
