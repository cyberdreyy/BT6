# Q3454: wallet create returns before the user is refreshed in walletCreate.ts

## Question
create()/add() call refreshSession after the iframe returns; can an attacker interleave a session change through createWalletApiWallet so the created wallet is attributed to a different user object?

## Target
- File/function: [src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts](src/embedded/stack/walletCreate.ts) - createWalletApiWallet, create (privy-idempotency-key header)
- Entrypoint: privy.embeddedWallet.create({idempotencyKey}) in user-controlled-server-wallets-only mode
- Attacker controls: idempotencyKey string, chainType, repeated concurrent creates
- Exploit idea: Change the active user between the iframe result and the refresh.
- Invariant to test: Wallet creation results must be attributed to the identity that requested them.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Integration test: switch users mid-call in createWalletApiWallet and assert the operation aborts.
