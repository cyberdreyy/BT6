# Q2504: sandbox flag selects the endpoint in generate.ts

## Question
getTransactionStatus picks the sandbox or prod key from a boolean; can an attacker flip that flag through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain so a sandbox transaction is presented to the user as a real one?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Call the status path with useSandbox toggled and inspect what the app reports.
- Invariant to test: Environment selection must be pinned by configuration, not per call.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: assert generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain derives the environment from configuration.
