# Q2828: caller-supplied request id in http_trigger_handler.HandleUserTriggerRequest

## Question
Does `HandleUserTriggerRequest` at HandleUserTriggerRequest on the public gateway endpoint (workflow HTTP trigger) accept a caller-chosen request id, letting any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests bind to or overwrite an in-flight request from another user?

## Target
- File/function: [core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_trigger_handler.go](core/services/gateway/handlers/capabilities/v2/http_trigger_handler.go) -> `HandleUserTriggerRequest`
- Entrypoint: HandleUserTriggerRequest on the public gateway endpoint (workflow HTTP trigger)
- Attacker controls: requestID/key and its derivation inputs (attacker capability: any internet client with an arbitrary externally-owned key sending signed gateway requests; no operator, admin, host, DB or DON-node privileges assumed)
- Exploit idea: Submit `requestID/key and its derivation inputs` reusing a victim's id.
- Invariant to test: request ids must be server-generated or sender-scoped
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - server credential theft: vault/DKG secret shares or decrypted user secrets disclosed to an unauthorized requester
- Fast validation: test submitting a duplicate id from a different sender
