# Q2724: init body carries the destination address in generate.ts

## Question
initOnRampSession forwards the caller's body including addresses and assets; can an attacker submit a destination through generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain that is not the user's wallet?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts](src/action/depositAddress/generate.ts) - generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain, source_currency, destination_chain, destination_currency, destination_address, refund_address, slippage_bps}
- Entrypoint: privy.depositAddress.generate({...})
- Attacker controls: every quote field, especially destination_address, refund_address and slippageBps
- Exploit idea: Submit a foreign address in the init body.
- Invariant to test: Funding destinations must be validated against the user's wallets.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - user funds routed to an address, chain, or asset the user did not choose (deposit, refund, on-ramp, or broadcast destination).
- Fast validation: Unit test: submit a foreign address to generateDepositAddress: body {source_chain and assert rejection.
