# Q3158: provider app id not compared to the account in signMessage.ts

## Question
sendCrossAppRequest derives providerAppId from the resolved account, then matches it against the connections list; can an attacker construct state so the two disagree and crossApp signMessage: params [message still proceeds?

## Target
- File/function: [src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts](src/action/crossApp/wallet/signMessage.ts) - crossApp signMessage: params [message, address], method chosen by isCrossAppWalletSmart
- Entrypoint: privy.crossApp.wallet.signMessage({user, address, message, redirectUrl})
- Attacker controls: message bytes/string, address, redirectUrl, provider response payload
- Exploit idea: Return a connections entry whose provider_app_id matches a different account.
- Invariant to test: Provider identity must be consistent across account and connection.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds: a signature or transaction the victim never approved is produced, broadcast, or made producible from their wallet.
- Fast validation: Unit test: create disagreeing state and assert crossApp signMessage: params [message refuses.
