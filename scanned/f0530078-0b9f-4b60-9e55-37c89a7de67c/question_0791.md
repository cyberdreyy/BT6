# Q0791: session_update_action drives local state in InMemoryStorage.ts

## Question
_refreshSession applies set/clear/ignore purely from the response's session_update_action; can an attacker influence that field's handling so tokens are stored under the current user without confirming the subject?

## Target
- File/function: [src/storage/InMemoryStorage.ts](src/storage/InMemoryStorage.ts) - InMemoryCache.get, put, del, getKeys (plain object _cache)
- Entrypoint: Privy({storage: new InMemoryCache()})
- Attacker controls: key strings reaching the object literal cache
- Exploit idea: Return a refresh response with 'set' and a user id different from the active one.
- Invariant to test: Applying a refresh result must verify the returned user matches the session being refreshed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: return a refresh payload for a different user and assert InMemoryCache.get refuses to store it.
