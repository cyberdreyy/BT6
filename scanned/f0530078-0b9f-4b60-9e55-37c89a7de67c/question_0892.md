# Q0892: update flow accepts mismatched old/new identifiers in TelegramApi.ts

## Question
In src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts, can an attacker submit an update request whose old identifier is not the one currently linked, so the code they hold is applied against a different identifier binding?

## Target
- File/function: [src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts](src/client/auth/TelegramApi.ts) - TelegramApi.authenticate, link, unlink
- Entrypoint: privy.auth.telegram.authenticate({telegramWebAppData, telegramAuthResult, captchaToken, mode})
- Attacker controls: telegram_web_app_data blob, telegram_auth_result, captcha_token, mode
- Exploit idea: Call the update method with an arbitrary old value plus a valid code for another identifier and observe client-side acceptance.
- Invariant to test: TelegramApi.authenticate must bind the verification code to the exact identifier pair currently on the account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - account takeover: an attacker gains authenticated control of another user's Privy account or session.
- Fast validation: Unit test: call the update method with mismatched old identifier and assert the SDK does not issue the request.
