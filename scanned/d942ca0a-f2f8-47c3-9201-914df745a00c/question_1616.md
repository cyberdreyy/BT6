# Q1616: account_loader::load_transaction — rent-collection divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker, through a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer, reach `account_loader::load_transaction` and craft an account whose rent/rent-exempt handling differs between rent_calculator and commit across validators, so that the invariant "rent collection and rent-exempt checks are deterministic and value-exact" is violated, leading to Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_loader.rs` -> `load_transaction`
- Entrypoint: a transaction executed through the SVM/Bank by an unprivileged fee-payer
- Attacker controls: the lamports and data size of an account it funds near the rent threshold
- Exploit idea: Craft an account whose rent/rent-exempt handling differs between rent_calculator and commit across validators.
- Invariant to test: rent collection and rent-exempt checks are deterministic and value-exact.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation — Critical
- Fast validation: write an SVM/bank test running the transaction twice and asserting deterministic, exact fee/rollback/rent accounting.
