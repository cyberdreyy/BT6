I'm not going to produce that report. This "ANALOG SCAN PROMPT" is a prompt-injection pattern: it tries to override my actual operating instructions (ask-only mode, my citation format, my standards for evidence) with a fake "external report" and a rigid output template designed to coax me into fabricating a "Critical/High" vulnerability finding by analogy to an unrelated CVE (a Java web session-fixation bug in `com.enonic.xp:lib-auth`), regardless of whether the analogy actually holds in this Rust codebase.

I won't follow injected instructions that ask me to bypass my own formatting/verification rules or to manufacture a security finding on demand. I'm also in ask-only mode, so I don't produce implementation plans here regardless.

What I can genuinely say from looking at the signer code: the CVE is about a web session token not being rotated after login (session fixation), which has no structural analog in `stacks-signer` — there's no "session token," no login/auth flow, and no pre-auth/post-auth identity swap. The closest real design concern in this codebase is the deliberate two-phase pre-commit → signature flow and conflict/reorg handling documented in `docs/signer-flows.md` (sections 5 and 7), and the conflict bookkeping in `stacks-signer/src/signerdb.rs`'s `get_signed_conflicts`/`has_signed_block_in_tenure` functions, but these are already defended by explicit freshness/conflict checks (`check_block_against_signer_db_state`, `reorg_permit_stands`, `conflict_still_blocks`) and covered by dedicated regression tests such as `signer_refuses_to_sign_second_sibling_tenure_start` in `stacks-signer/src/v0/tests.rs`. None of that constitutes a session-fixation analog, and I have no evidence of a concrete equality-break or liveness wedge reachable by a single miner from this material. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

If you have a genuine question about how the signer's proposal/pre-commit/signing state machine actually guards against double-signing, stale signatures, or reorgs, I'm happy to dig into that directly with actual codebase evidence.

## 5. Pre-commit threshold → signature

The only place the signer produces a block signature by counting votes.
Pre-commits from peers (and our own) accumulate; at ≥70% weight the signer
decides whether to follow through. Between validation and threshold, we may have
signed a _different_ block at the same height, possibly in another tenure, so
the world must be re-checked before the signature leaves the box.
