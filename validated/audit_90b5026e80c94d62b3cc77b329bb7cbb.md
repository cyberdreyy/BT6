No vulnerability found for this question.

The reported bug class is specific to ERC4626-style vaults that track `accPnlPerToken` as a per-share accumulator serving two conflicting purposes (absolute PnL tracking and share-price scaling). The in-scope NEAR contracts do not contain this pattern. The `staking-pool` contract computes share price directly as `total_staked_balance / total_stake_shares` and both staking and unstaking consistently price against this single live ratio via `num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_down/up` and `staked_amount_from_num_shares_rounded_down/up` [1](#0-0) , with rewards distributed by directly increasing `total_staked_balance` (and minting owner shares at the new price) rather than through a separate per-share PnL accumulator that needs scaling [2](#0-1) . There is no `scaleVariables()`-equivalent function, no separate "PnL per token" state variable, and no design choice that ignores negative accumulated values for pricing purposes — deposit/stake and withdraw/unstake never move the share price because both charge and credit amounts are derived from the same total_staked_balance/total_stake_shares ratio at the time of the call [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) . The remaining in-scope contracts (`lockup`, `lockup-factory`, `staking-pool-factory`, `multisig-factory`, `whitelist`, `voting`, `multisig`, `multisig2`, `w-near`, `state-manipulation`) do not implement any share-token/vault accounting at all, so there is no reachable path for this bug class that would break a custody-binding equality (claims vs. assets held) as required by the validation rules.
