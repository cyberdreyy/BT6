## Analysis: Unordered execution of independently-allowlisted Vault requests

The `PermitC`/Pearlmit bug class centers on unordered nonces: each signed operation is validated independently, so a party relaying multiple pre-authorized operations can execute them in any order (or selectively), producing a final state the signer never intended. The Vault gateway's allowlist-based authorization has the same structural property.

### Root cause

`AllowListBasedAuth.AuthorizeRequest` authorizes a request purely by checking whether its content digest matches *any* not-yet-expired entry previously registered on-chain via `WorkflowRegistry.AllowlistRequest` — it does not verify who is submitting the HTTP request, nor does it enforce any relationship/order between multiple allowlisted digests belonging to the same owner: [1](#0-0) 

Each digest is tracked completely independently in the on-chain allowlist (`w.allowListedRequests`), with only an expiry timestamp — no sequence number or ordering constraint across entries for the same owner: [2](#0-1) 

The only per-request safeguard is a digest-based replay guard, which prevents the *same* digest from being executed twice, but does nothing to constrain the order or completeness of a *set* of different digests that were meant to run as an ordered sequence (e.g., create → update → delete for a secret lifecycle): [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) 

The gateway request processor then commits each request independently as soon as it is authorized — there's no atomic/ordered batch concept tying together the full set of pre-authorized operations a workflow owner intends to run as a unit: [5](#0-4) 

### Why this is an analog of the "unordered nonces" issue

- Authorization is granted solely because a request's **digest** matches a pre-registered allowlist entry — not because the *submitter* is authenticated as the owner and not because of any sequence position. Any actor holding the exact JSON-RPC payload for an allowlisted digest can submit it to the public gateway HTTP endpoint.
- If a workflow owner allowlists multiple related operations meant to run as an ordered sequence (e.g., `secrets.create` a new value, then `secrets.delete` an old one, then `secrets.update`), a relayer/unprivileged submitter can:
  - Submit them out of order, producing an end secret state that differs from the intended one (e.g., delete a secret that was supposed to be immediately re-created, leaving it permanently gone, or vice versa).
  - Submit only a subset (e.g., the create but never the delete), leaving stale secret values active indefinitely — since each digest is authorized/executed completely independently with no "all-or-nothing" linkage.
- This mirrors the report's core theme: independent per-operation authorization without ordering/atomicity guarantees lets whoever controls submission order/timing determine the final outcome, rather than the signer's intended sequence.

### Caveat / limitation of the analog

Unlike the Tapioca/PermitC case, this is not about value-transfer allowances but about final **state of stored secrets** (create/update/delete) diverging from the owner's intended sequence. The severity is bounded by what a manipulated ordering of Vault CRUD operations can achieve — e.g., causing stale/incorrect secret material to remain accessible to workflows longer than intended, or a delete happening prematurely. I was not able to find, within the indexed code, a batched/atomic "linked-request" mechanism (equivalent to Tapioca's `Pearlmit` batch which enforces submission order) protecting multi-step Vault allowlist sequences — but the actual severity depends on how workflow owners construct and rely on multi-step allowlisted request sequences in production, which is not something I can fully evaluate from static code alone. If you want, I can look further into how the workflow-owner tooling packages and expects these multi-request sequences to be submitted, to better bound the real-world impact.
