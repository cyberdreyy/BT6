Based on review of the custody-critical paths across all in-scope contracts:

- **staking-pool** (`internal_stake`, `internal_withdraw`, share/balance conversion functions in `staking-pool/src/internal.rs`) — the account ID used for charging/crediting is consistently `env::predecessor_account_id()` throughout deposit, stake, unstake, and withdraw; no mismatched identity is stored in place of the intended party. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

- **lockup** (`get_locked_amount`, `get_unvested_amount` in `lockup/src/getters.rs`) — the release/vesting math is applied against `self.lockup_information.lockup_amount` and the account's own vesting schedule consistently; no other account's identifier or balance is substituted in. [3](#0-2) 

- **whitelist** (`add_staking_pool`, `assert_called_by_foundation` in `whitelist/src/lib.rs`) — trust is granted strictly based on `env::predecessor_account_id()` against `factory_whitelist`/`foundation_account_id`; the account being whitelisted (`staking_pool_account_id`) is the argument passed in, not confused with `env::current_account_id()` or the caller's identity. [4](#0-3) 

- **staking-pool-factory** (`create_staking_pool`, `on_staking_pool_create`) — the newly created pool's account ID (`staking_pool_account_id`) is the one whitelisted via `ext_whitelist::add_staking_pool`, matching the account actually deployed/funded.
