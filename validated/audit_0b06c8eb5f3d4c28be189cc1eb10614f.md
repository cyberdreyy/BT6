 - each stake-management operation (add/unlock/reactivate/withdraw) and operator change triggers
the synchronization process before executing its own function.
 - each OLC maps to one or more real lockups on the stake pool, but not the opposite. Actually, only a real
lockup with 'activity' (which inactivated some unlocking stake) triggers the creation of a new OLC.
 - unlocking and/or unlocked stake originating from different real lockups are never mixed together into
